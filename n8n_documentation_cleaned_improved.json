    "content": "n8n v1.0 migration guide\nThis document provides a summary of what you should be aware of before updating to version 1.0 of n8n.\nThe release of n8n 1.0 marks a milestone in n8n's journey to make n8n available for demanding production environments. Version 1.0 represents the hard work invested over the last four years to make n8n the most accessible, powerful, and versatile automation tool. n8n 1.0 is now ready for use in production.\nNew features\nPython support in the Code node\nAlthough JavaScript remains the default language, you can now also select Python as an option in the Code node and even make use of many Python modules. Note that Python is unavailable in Code nodes added to a workflow before v1.0.\nPR #4295, PR #6209\nExecution order\nn8n 1.0 introduces a new execution order for multi-branch workflows:\nIn multi-branch workflows, n8n needs to determine the order in which to execute nodes on branches. Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first.\nn8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute.\nYour existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order. You can configure the execution order for each workflow in workflow settings.\nPR #4238, PR #6246, PR #6507\nDeprecations\nMySQL and MariaDB\nn8n has deprecated support for MySQL and MariaDB as storage backends for n8n. These database systems are used by only a few users, yet they require continuous development and maintenance efforts. n8n recommends migrating to PostgreSQL for better compatibility and long-term support.\nPR #6189\nEXECUTIONS_PROCESS and \"own\" mode\nPreviously, you could use the EXECUTIONS_PROCESS environment variable to specify whether executions should run in the main process or in their own processes. This option and own mode are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of n8n. This is because it led to increased code complexity while offering marginal benefits. Starting from n8n 1.0, main will be the new default.\nNote that executions start much faster in main mode than in own mode. However, if a workflow consumes more memory than is available, it might crash the entire n8n application instead of just the worker thread. To mitigate this, make sure to allocate enough system resources or configure queue mode to distribute executions among multiple workers.\nPR #6196\nBreaking changes\nDocker\nPermissions change\nWhen using Docker-based deployments, the n8n process is now run by the user node instead of root. This change increases security.\nIf permission errors appear in your n8n container logs when starting n8n, you may need to update the permissions by executing the following command on the Docker host:\nImage removal\nWe've removed the Debian and RHEL images. If you were using these you need to change the image you use. This shouldn't result in any errors unless you were making a custom image based on one of those images.\nEntrypoint change\nThe entrypoint for the container has changed and you no longer need to specify the n8n command. If you were previously running n8n worker --concurrency=5 it's now worker --concurrency=5\nPR #6365\nWorkflow failures due to expression errors\nWorkflow executions may fail due to syntax or runtime errors in expressions, such as those that reference non-existent nodes. While expressions already throw errors on the frontend, this change ensures that n8n also throws errors on the backend, where they were previously silently ignored. To receive notifications of failing workflows, n8n recommends setting up an \"error workflow\" under workflow settings.\nPR #6352\nMandatory owner account\nThis change makes User Management mandatory and removes support for other authentication methods, such as BasicAuth and External JWT. Note that the number of permitted users on n8n.cloud or custom plans still varies depending on your subscription.\nPR #6362\nDirectory for installing custom nodes\nn8n will no longer load custom nodes from its global node_modules directory. Instead, you must install (or link) them to ~/.n8n/custom (or a directory defined by N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS). Custom nodes that are npm packages will be located in ~/.n8n/nodes.\nIf you have custom nodes that were linked using npm link into the global node_modules directory, you need to link them again, into ~/.n8n/nodes instead.\nPR #6396\nWebSockets\nThe N8N_PUSH_BACKEND environment variable can be used to configure one of two available methods for pushing updates to the user interface: sse and websocket. Starting with n8n 1.0, websocket is the default method.\nPR #6196\nDate transformation functions\nn8n provides various transformation functions that operate on dates. These functions may return either a JavaScript Date or a Luxon DateTime object. With the new behavior, the return type always matches the input. If you call a date transformation function on a Date, it returns a Date. Similarly, if you call it on a DateTime object, it returns a DateTime object.\nTo identify any workflows and nodes that might be impacted by this change, you can use this utility workflow.\nFor more information about date transformation functions, please refer to the official documentation.\nPR #6435\nExecution data retention\nStarting from n8n 1.0, all successful, failed, and manual workflow executions will be saved by default. These settings can be modified for each workflow under \"Workflow Settings,\" or globally using the respective environment variables. Additionally, the EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE setting will be enabled by default, with EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT set to 10,000. These default settings are designed to prevent performance degradation when using SQLite. Make sure to configure them according to your individual requirements and system capacity.\nPR #6577\nRemoved N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB\nThe legacy request library has been deprecated for some time now. As of n8n 1.0, the ability to fall back to it in the HTTP Request node by setting the N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB environment variable has been fully removed. The HTTP Request node will now always use the new HttpRequest interface.\nIf you build custom nodes, refer to HTTP request helpers for more information on migrating to the new interface.\nPR #6413\nRemoved WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL\nAs of version 0.227.0, n8n has renamed the WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL configuration option to WEBHOOK_URL. In n8n 1.0, WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL has been removed. Update your setup to reflect the new name. For more information about this configuration option, refer to the docs.\nPR #1408\nRemove Node 16 support\nn8n now requires Node 18.17.0 or above.\nUpdating to n8n 1.0\nCreate a full backup of n8n.\nn8n recommends updating to the latest n8n 0.x release before updating to n8n 1.x. This will allow you to pinpoint any potential issues to the correct release. Once you have verified that n8n 0.x starts up without any issues, proceed to the next step.\nCarefully read the Deprecations and Breaking Changes sections above to assess how they may affect your setup.\nUpdate to n8n 1.0:\nDuring beta (before July 24th 2023): If using Docker, pull the next Docker image.\nAfter July 24th 2023: If using Docker, pull the latest Docker image.\nIf you encounter any issues, redeploy the previous n8n version and restore the backup.\nReporting issues\nIf you encounter any issues during the process of updating to n8n 1.0, please seek help in the community forum.\nThank you\nWe would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of our users for their continued support and feedback. Your contributions are invaluable in helping us make n8n the best possible automation tool. We're excited to continue working with you as we move forward with the release of version 1.0 and beyond. Thank you for being a part of our journey!"

    "file_path": "external-secrets.md",
    "content": "External secrets\nYou can use an external secrets store to manage credentials for n8n.\nn8n stores all credentials encrypted in its database, and restricts access to them by default. With the external secrets feature, you can store sensitive credential information in an external vault, and have n8n load it in when required. This provides an extra layer of security and allows you to manage credentials used across multiple n8n environments in one central place.\nConnect n8n to your secrets store\nIn n8n, go to Settings > External Secrets.\nSelect Set Up for your store provider.\nEnter the credentials for your provider:\nAzure Key Vault: Provide your vault name, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret. Refer to the Azure documentation to register a Microsoft Entra ID app and create a service principal. n8n supports only single-line values for secrets.\nAWS Secrets Manager: provide your access key ID, secret access key, and region. The IAM user must have the secretsmanager:ListSecrets, secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue, and secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permissions.\nTo give n8n access to all secrets in your AWS Secrets Manager, you can attach the following policy to the IAM user:\nYou can also be more restrictive and give n8n access to select specific AWS Secret Manager secrets. You still need to allow the secretsmanager:ListSecrets and secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue permissions to access all resources. These permissions allow n8n to retrieve ARN-scoped secrets, but don't provide access to the secret values.\nNext, you need set the scope for the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission to the specific Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the secrets you wish to share with n8n. Ensure you use the correct region and account ID in each resource ARNs. You can find the ARN details in the AWS dashboard for your secrets.\nFor example, the following IAM policy only allows access to secrets with a name starting with n8n in your specified AWS account and region:\nFor more IAM permission policy examples, consult the AWS documentation.\nHashiCorp Vault: provide the Vault URL for your vault instance, and select your Authentication Method.  Enter your authentication details. Optionally provide a namespace.\nRefer to the HashiCorp documentation for your authentication method:\nToken auth method\nAppRole auth method\nUserpass auth method\nIf you use vault namespaces, you can enter the namespace n8n should connect to. Refer to Vault Enterprise namespaces for more information on HashiCorp Vault namespaces.\nInfisical: provide a Service Token. Refer to Infisical's Service token documentation for information on getting your token. If you self-host Infisical, enter the Site URL.\nGoogle Cloud Platform: provide a Service Account Key (JSON) for a service account that has at least these roles: Secret Manager Secret Accessor and Secret Manager Secret Viewer. Refer to Google's service account documentation for more information.\nSave your configuration.\nEnable the provider using the Disabled / Enabled toggle.\nUse secrets in n8n credentials\nTo use a secret from your store in an n8n credential:\nCreate a new credential, or open an existing one.\nOn the field where you want to use a secret:\nHover over the field.\nSelect Expression.\nIn the field where you want to use a secret, enter an expression referencing the secret name:\nis either vault (for HashiCorp) or infisical or awsSecretsManager. Replace  with the name as it appears in your vault.\nUsing external secrets with n8n environments\nn8n's Source control and environments feature allows you to create different n8n environments, backed by Git. The feature doesn't support using different credentials in different instances. You can use an external secrets vault to provide different credentials for different environments by connecting each n8n instance to a different vault or project environment.\nFor example, you have two n8n instances, one for development and one for production. You use Infisical for your vault. In Infisical, create a project with two environments, development and production. Generate a token for each Infisical environment. Use the token for the development environment to connect your development n8n instance, and the token for your production environment to connect your production n8n instance.\nUsing external secrets in projects\nTo use external secrets in an RBAC project, you must have an instance owner or instance admin as a member of the project.\nTroubleshooting\nInfisical version changes\nInfisical version upgrades can introduce problems connecting to n8n. If your Infisical connection stops working, check if there was a recent version change. If so, report the issue to help@n8n.io.\nOnly set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin\nDue to the permissions that instance owners and admins have, it's possible for owners and admins to update credentials owned by another user with a secrets expression. This will appear to work in preview for an instance owner or admin, but the secret won't resolve when the workflow runs in production.\nOnly use external secrets for credentials that are owned by an instance admin or owner. This ensures they resolve correctly in production."

    "content": "AI agent\nAI agents are artificial intelligence systems capable of responding to requests, making decisions, and performing real-world tasks for users. They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.\nAI chain\nAI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this).\nAI embedding\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.\nAI groundedness\nIn AI, and specifically in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) contexts, groundedness and ungroundedness are measures of how much a model's responses accurately reflect source information. The model uses its source documents to generate grounded responses, while ungrounded responses involve speculation or hallucination unsupported by those same sources.\nAI reranking\nReranking is a technique that refines the order of a list of candidate documents to improve the relevance of search results. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other applications use reranking to prioritize the most relevant information for generation or downstream tasks.\nAI memory\nIn an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't.\nAI retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nRetrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a technique for providing LLMs access to new information from external sources to improve AI responses. RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge to supplement their original training data. RAG systems often rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.\nAI tool\nIn an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks.\nAI vector store\nVector stores, or vector databases, are databases designed to store numerical representations of information called embeddings.\nAPI\nAPIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI.\ncanvas (n8n)\nThe canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows.\ncluster node (n8n)\nIn n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.\ncredential (n8n)\nIn n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service.\ndata pinning (n8n)\nData pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution.\neditor (n8n)\nThe n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more.\nentitlement (n8n)\nIn n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time.\nFloating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance.\nevaluation (n8n)\nIn n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows.\nexpression (n8n)\nIn n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment.\nLangChain\nLangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications.\nLarge language model (LLM)\nLarge language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data.\nnode (n8n)\nIn n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services.\nproject (n8n)\nn8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources.\nroot node (n8n)\nEach n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.\nsub node (n8n)\nn8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.\ntemplate (n8n)\nn8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.\ntrigger node (n8n)\nA trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.\nworkflow (n8n)\nAn n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks."

They include:\nTotal production executions (not including sub-workflow executions or manual executions)\nTotal failed production executions\nProduction execution failure rate\nTime saved (when set on at least one or more active workflows)\nRun time average (including wait time from any wait nodes)\nInsights dashboard\nThose on the Pro and Enterprise plans can access the Insights section from the side navigation. Each metric from the summary banner is also clickable, taking you to the corresponding chart.\nThe insights dashboard also has a table showing individual insights from each workflow including total production executions, failed production executions, failure rate, time saved, and run time average.\nInsights time periods\nBy default, the insights summary banner and dashboard show a rolling 7 day window with a comparison to the previous period to identify increases or decreases for each metric. On the dashboard, paid plans also display data for other date ranges:\nPro: 7 and 14 days\nEnterprise: 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year\nSetting the time saved by a workflow\nFor each workflow, you can set the number of minutes of work a workflow saves you each time it runs. You can configure this by navigating to the workflow, selecting the three dots menu in the top right and selecting settings. There you can update the Estimated time saved value and save.\nThis setting helps you calculate how much time automating a process saves over time vs the manual effort to complete the same task or process.

This means that it doesn't count manual (test) executions or executions from sub-workflows or error workflows.\nDoes n8n use historic execution data when upgrading to a version with insights?\nn8n only starts collecting data for insights once you update to the first supported version (1.89.0). This means it only reports on executions from that point forward and you won't see execution data in insights from prior periods."

Version numbers increment as follows:\nMAJOR version when making incompatible changes which can require user action.\nMINOR version when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.\nPATCH version when making backward-compatible bug fixes.\nn8n@1.104.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-23\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.103.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-22\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.104.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-21\n=======\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, a new node, node updates, and bug fixes.\nContributors\nnunulk\niaptsiauri\nKGuillaume-chaps\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.101.3\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-18\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.102.4\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-17\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.103.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-17\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.102.3\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-14\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.103.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-14\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, new nodes, node improvements, and bug fixes.\nImproved instance user list with more visibility\nThe instance user list has been updated with a new table layout and additional details to help admins manage access more easily.\nYou can now:\nSee total users and filter by name or email\nView which projects each user has access to\nWhether a user has enabled 2FA and sort based on that\nSee the last active date for each user\nThis makes it easier to audit user activity, identify inactive accounts, and understand how access is distributed across your instance.\n!Improved instance user list with more visbility screenshot\nWebhook HTML responses\nStarting with this release, if your workflow sends an HTML response to a webhook, n8n automatically wraps the content in an . This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.\nThis has the following implications:\nHTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.\nJavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.\nAuthentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.\nRelative URLs (for example, ) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.\n### Built-in Metrics for AI Evaluations\nUsing evaluations is a best practice for any AI solution, and a must if reliability and predictability are business-critical. With this release, we’ve made it easier to set up evaluations in n8n by introducing a set of built-in metrics. These metrics can review AI responses and assign scores based on factors like correctness, helpfulness, and more.\nYou can run regular evaluations and review scores over time as a way to monitor your AI workflow's performance. You can also compare results across different models to help guide model selection, or run evaluations before and after a prompt change to support data-driven, iterative building.\nAs with all evaluations in n8n, you’ll need a dataset that includes the inputs you want to test. For some evaluations, the dataset must also include expected outputs (ground truth) to compare against. The evaluation workflow runs each input through the portion you're testing to generate a response. The built-in metric scores each response based on the aspect you're measuring, allowing you to compare results before and after changes or track trends over time in the Evaluations tab.\nYou can still define your own custom metrics, but for common use cases, the built-in options make it much faster to implement.\n🛠️ **How to:**\n1. Set up your evaluation as described here, using an **Evaluation** node as the trigger and another with the **Set Metrics** operation.\n2. In the **Set Metrics** node, choose a metric from the dropdown list.\n3. Define any additional parameters required for your selected metric. In most cases, this includes mapping the dataset columns to the appropriate fields.\n📏 **Available built-in metrics:**\n- **Correctness (AI-based):** Compares AI workflow-generated responses to expected answers. Another LLM acts as a judge, scoring the responses based on guidance you provide in the prompt.\n- **Helpfulness (AI-based):** Evaluates how helpful a response is in relation to a user query, using an LLM and prompt-defined scoring criteria.\n- **String Similarity:** Measures how closely the response matches the expected output by comparing strings. Useful for command generation or when output needs to follow a specific structure.\n- **Categorization:** Checks whether a response matches an expected label, such as assigning items to the correct category.\n- **Tools Used:** Verifies whether the AI agent called the tools you specified in your dataset.\nTo enable this, make sure **Return Intermediate Steps** is turned on in your agent so the evaluation can access the tools it actually called.\n🧠 Keep in mind\n- Registered Community Edition enables analysis of one evaluation in the **Evaluations** tab which allows easy comparison of evaluation runs over time. Pro and Enterprise plans allow unlimited evaluations in the **Evaluations** tab.\n!Built-in Metrics\nBuilt-in Metrics\nLearn more about setting up and customizing evaluations.\nAI Agent Tool node\nWith the AI Agent Tool node we are introducing a simplified pattern for multi-agent orchestration that can be run in a single execution and stay entirely on one canvas. You can now connect multiple AI Agent Tool nodes to a primary AI Agent node, allowing it to supervise and delegate work across other specialized agents.\nThis setup is especially useful for building complex systems that function like real-world teams, where a lead agent assigns parts of a task to specialists. You can even add multiple layers of agents directing other agents, just like you would have in a real multi-tiered organizational structure.  It also helps with prompt management by letting you split long, complex instructions into smaller, focused tasks across multiple agents. While similar orchestration was already possible using sub-workflows, AI Agent Tool nodes are a good choice when you want the interaction to happen within a single execution or prefer to manage and debug everything from a single canvas.\n🛠️ How to:\nAdd an AI Agent node to your workflow and click + to create a Tools connection.\nSearch for and select the AI Agent Tool node from the Nodes Panel.\nName the node clearly so the primary agent can reference it, then add a short description and prompt.\nConnect any LLMs, memory, and tools the agent needs to perform its role.\nInstruct the primary AI Agent on when to use the AI Agent Tool and to pass along relevant context in its prompt.\n🧠 Keep in mind:\nThe orchestrating agent does not pass full execution context by default. Any necessary context must be included in the prompt.\nAI Agent Tool nodes makes it easier to build layered, agent-to-agent workflows without relying on sub-workflows, helping you move faster when building and debugging multi-agent systems.\n!\nAI Agent Tool node\nContributors\nksg97031\nisraelshenkar\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.102.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-11\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.101.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-11\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.102.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-09\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.102.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-07\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, new nodes, node updates, and bug fixes.\nEnforce 2FA across your instance\nEnterprise Instance owners can now enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users in their instance.\nOnce enabled, any user who hasn’t set up 2FA will be redirected to complete the setup before they can continue using n8n. This helps organizations meet internal security policies and ensures stronger protection across the workspace.\nThis feature is available only on the Enterprise plan.\nContributors\nmarty-sullivan\ncesars-gh\ndudanogueira\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.101.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-07-03\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.101.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-30\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\nContributors\nluka-mimi\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.100.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-25\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.100.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-23\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, a new node, node updates, and bug fixes.\nModel Selector node\nThe Model Selector node gives you more control when working with multiple LLMs in your workflows.\nUse it to determine which connected model should handle a given input, based on conditions like expressions or global variables. This makes it easier to implement model routing strategies, such as switching models based on performance, task type, cost, or availability.\n🛠️ How to: Connect multiple model nodes to the Model Selector node, then configure routing conditions in the node’s settings.\n🧠 Keep in mind:\nRules are evaluated in order. The first matching rule determines which model is used even if others would also match.\nAs a sub-node, expressions behave differently here: they always resolves to the first item rather than resolving for each item in turn.\nThe Model Selector node is especially useful in evaluation or production scenarios where routing logic between models needs to adapt based on performance, cost, availability, or dataset-specific needs.\n!Model Selector node\nModel Selector node\nSupport for OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication\nYou can now use OIDC (OpenID Connect) as an authentication method for Single Sign-On (SSO).\nThis gives enterprise teams more flexibility to integrate n8n with their existing identity providers using a widely adopted and easy-to-manage standard. OIDC is now available alongside SAML, giving Enterprises the choice to select what best fits their internal needs.\nProject admins can now commit to Git within environments\nProject admins now have the ability to commit workflow and credential changes directly to Git through the environments feature. This update streamlines the workflow deployment process by giving project-level admins direct control over committing their changes. It also ensures that the those who know their workflows best can review and commit updates themselves, without needing to involve instance-level admins.\nLearn more about source control environments\nContributors\naliou\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.99.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-19\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.98.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-18\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.99.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-16\nThis release contains performance improvements, core updates, editor changes, node updates, and bug fixes.\nAutomatically name nodes\nDefault node names now update automatically based on the resource and operation selected, so you’ll always know what a node does at a glance.\nThis adds clarity to your canvas and saves time renaming nodes manually.\nDon’t worry, automatic naming won’t break references. And, and if you’ve renamed a node yourself, we’ll leave it just the way you wrote it.\nSupport for RAG extended with built-in templates\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can improve AI responses by providing language models access to data sources with up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge. RAG workflows typically rely on vector stores to manage and search this data efficiently.\nTo get the benefits of using vector stores, such as returning results based on semantic meaning rather than just keyword matches, you need a way to upload your data to the vector store and a way to query it.\nIn n8n, uploading and querying vectors stores happens in two workflows. Now, you have an example to get your started and make implementation easier with the RAG starter template.\nThe Load Data workflow shows how to add data with the appropriate embedding model, split it into chunks with the Default Data Loader, and add metadata as desired.\nThe Retriever workflow for querying data, shows how  agents and vector stores work together to help you define highly relevant results and save tokens using the Question and Answer tool.\nEnable semantic search and the retrieval of unstructured data  for increased quality and relevance of AI responses.\n🛠️ How to:\nSearch for RAG starter template in the search bar of the Nodes panel to insert it into your workflow.\nLearn more about implementing RAG in n8n here.\n!RAG starter template\nRAG starter template\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.98.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-12\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.98.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-11\nThis release contains performance improvements, core updates, editor changes, node updates, a new node, and bug fixes.\nContributors\nluka-mimi\nAlexandero89\nkhoazero123\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.97.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-04\nThis release contains backports.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.95.3\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-03\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.97.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-02\nThis release contains new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.\nConvert to sub-workflow\nLarge, monolithic workflows can slow things down. They’re harder to maintain, tougher to debug, and more difficult to scale. With sub-workflows, you can take a more modular approach, breaking up big workflows into smaller, manageable parts that are easier to reuse, test, understand, and explain.\nUntil now, creating sub-workflows required copying and pasting nodes manually, setting up a new workflow from scratch, and reconnecting everything by hand. Convert to sub-workflow allows you to simplify this process into a single action, so you can spend more time building and less time restructuring.\nHow it works\nHighlight the nodes you want to convert to a sub-workflow. These must:\nBe fully connected, meaning no missing steps in between them\nStart from a single starting node\nEnd with a single node\nRight-click to open the context menu and select Convert to sub-workflow\nOr use the shortcut: Alt + X\nn8n will:\nOpen a new tab containing the selected nodes\nPreserve all node parameters as-is\nReplace the selected nodes in the original workflow with a Call My Sub-workflow node\nNote: You will need to manually adjust the field types in the Start and Return nodes in the new sub-workflow.\nThis makes it easier to keep workflows modular, performant, and easier to maintain.\nLearn more about sub-workflows.\nThis release contains performance improvements and bug fixes.\nContributors\nmaatthc\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.96.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-06-02\nThis release contains API updates, core changes, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\nAPI support for assigning users to projects\nYou can now use the API to add and update users within projects. This includes:\nAssigning existing or pending users to a project with a specific role\nUpdating a user’s role within a project\nRemoving users from one or more projects\nThis update now allows you to use the API to add users to both the instance and specific projects, removing the need to manually assign them in the UI.\nAdd pending users to project member assignment\nYou can now add pending users, those who have been invited but haven't completed sign-up, to projects as members.\nThis change lets you configure a user's project access upfront, without waiting for them to finish setting up their account. It eliminates the back-and-forth of managing access post-sign-up, ensuring users have the right project roles immediately upon joining.\nContributors\nmatthabermehl\nStamsy\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.95.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-05-29\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.95.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-05-27\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.94.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-05-27\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.95.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-05-26\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\n### Evaluations for AI workflows\nWe’ve added a feature to help you iterate, test, and compare changes to your AI automations before pushing them to production so you can achieve more predictability and make better decisions.\nWhen you're building with AI, a small prompt tweak or model swap might improve results with some inputs, while quietly degrading performance with others. But without a way to evaluate performance across many inputs, you’re left guessing whether your AI is actually getting better when you make a change.\nBy implementing **Evaluations for AI workflows** in n8n, you can assess how your AI performs across a range of inputs by adding a dedicated path in your workflow for running test cases and applying custom metrics to track results. This helps you build viable proof-of-concepts quickly, iterate more effectively, catch regressions early, and make more confident decisions when your AI is in production.\n#### Evaluation node and tab\nThe **Evaluation node** includes several operations that, when used together, enable end-to-end AI evaluation.\n!Evaluation node\nEvaluation node\nUse this node to:\n- Run your AI logic against a wide range of test cases in the same execution\n- Capture the outputs of those test cases\n- Score the results using your own metrics or LLM-as-judge logic\n- Isolate a testing path to only include the nodes and logic you want to evaluate\nThe **Evaluations tab** enables you to review test results in the n8n UI, perfect for comparing runs, spotting regressions, and viewing performance over time.\n#### 🛠 How evaluations work\nThe evaluation path runs alongside your normal execution logic and only activates when you want—making it ideal for testing and iteration.\nGet started by selecting an AI workflow you want to evaluate that includes one or more LLM or Agent nodes.\n1. Add an **Evaluation** node with the **On new Evaluation event** operation. This node will act as an additional trigger you’ll run only when testing. Configure it to read your dataset from Google Sheets, with each row representing a test input.\n> 💡  Better datasets mean better evaluations. Craft your dataset from a variety of test cases, including edge cases and typical inputs, to get meaningful feedback on how your AI performs. Learn more and access sample datasets here.\n2. Add a second **Evaluation** node using the **Set Outputs** operation after the part of the workflow you're testing—typically after an LLM or Agent node. This captures the response and writes it back to your dataset in Google Sheets.\n3. To evaluate output quality, add a third **Evaluation** node with the **Set Metrics** operation at a point after you’ve generated the outputs. You can develop workflow logic, custom calculations, or add an LLM-as-Judge to score the outputs. Map these metrics to your dataset in the node’s parameters.\n> 💡 Well-defined metrics = smarter decisions. Scoring your outputs based on similarity, correctness, or categorization can help you track whether changes are actually improving performance. Learn more and get links to example templates here.\n!Evaluation workflow\nEvaluation workflow\nWhen the Evaluation trigger node is executed, it runs each input in our dataset through your AI logic. This continues until all test cases are processed, a limit is reached, or you manually stop the execution. Once your evaluation path is set up, you can update your prompt, model, or workflow logic—and re-run the Evaluation trigger node to compare results. If you’ve added metrics, they’ll appear in the Evaluations tab.\nIn some instances, you may want to isolate your testing path to make iteration faster or to avoid executing downstream logic.  In this case, you can add an Evaluation node with the Check If Evaluating operation to ensure only the expected nodes run when performing evaluations.\n#### Things to keep in mind\nEvaluations for AI Workflows are designed to fit  into your development flow, with more enhancements on the way. For now, here are a few things to note:\n- Test datasets are currently managed through Google Sheets. You’ll need a Google Sheets credential to run evaluations.\n- Each workflow supports one evaluation at a time. If you’d like to test multiple segments, consider splitting them into sub-workflows for more flexibility.\n- Community Edition supports one single evaluation. Pro and Enterprise plans allow unlimited evaluations.\n- AI Evaluations are not enabled for instances in scaling mode at this time.\nYou can find details, tips, and common troubleshooting info here.\n👉 Learn more about the AI evaluation strategies and practical implementation techniques.

Now you can access a select set of community nodes and partner integrations without leaving the canvas. This means you install and automate with a wider range of integrations without leaving your workspace. The power of the community is now built-in.\nThis update focuses on three major improvements:\n- **Cloud availability**: Community nodes are no longer just for self-hosted users. A select set of nodes is now available on n8n Cloud.\n- **Built-in discovery**: You can find and explore these nodes right from the Nodes panel without leaving the editor or searching on npm.\n- **Trust and verification**: Nodes that appear in the editor have been manually vetted for quality and security. These verified nodes are marked with a checkmark.\nWe’re starting with a selection of around 25 nodes, including some of the most-used community-built packages and partner-supported integrations. For this phase, we focused on nodes that don’t include external package dependencies - helping streamline the review process and ensure a smooth rollout.\nThis is just the start. We plan to expand the library gradually, bringing even more verified nodes into the editor along with the powerful and creative use cases they unlock. In time, our criteria will evolve, opening the door to a wider range of contributions while keeping quality and security in focus.\nLearn more about this update and find out which nodes are already installable from the editor in our blog post.\n💻 **Use a verified node**\nMake sure you're on **n8n version 1.94.0** or later and the instance Owner has enabled verified community nodes. On Cloud, this can be done from the Admin Panel. For self-hosted instances, please refer to documentation. In both cases, verified nodes are enabled by default.\n- Open the **Nodes panel** from the editor\n- Search for the Node. Verified nodes are indicated by a shield 🛡️\n- Select the node and click **Install**\nOnce an Owner installs a node, everyone on the instance can start using it—just drag, drop, and connect like any other node in your workflow.\n🛠️ **Build a node and get it verified**\nWant your node to be verified and discoverable from the editor? Here’s how to get involved:\n1. Review the community node verification guidelines.\n2. If you’re building something new, follow the recommendations for creating nodes.\n3. Check your design against the UX guidelines.\n4. Submit your node to npm.\n5. Request verification by filling out this form.\n**Already built a node? Raise your hand!**\nIf you’ve already published a community node and want it considered for verification, make sure it meets the requirements noted above, then let us know by submitting the interest form. We’re actively curating the next batch and would love to include your work.\nExtended logs view\nWhen workflows get complex, debugging can get... clicky. That’s where an extended Logs View comes in. Now you can get a clearer path to trace executions, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of a complete workflow — without bouncing between node detail views.\nThis update brings a unified, always-accessible panel to the bottom of the canvas, showing you each step of the execution as it happens. Whether you're working with loops, sub-workflows, or AI agents, you’ll see a structured view of everything that ran, in the order it ran—with input, output, and status info right where you need it.\nYou can jump into node details when you want to dig deeper, or follow a single item through every step it touched. Real-time highlighting shows you which nodes are currently running or have failed, and you’ll see total execution time for any workflow—plus token usage for AI workflows to help monitor performance. And if you're debugging across multiple screens? Just pop the logs out and drag them wherever you’d like.\n⚙️What it does\nAdds a Logs view to the bottom of the canvas that can be opened or collapsed.

You can now run and test specific tools without having to execute the entire agent workflow.\nPartial execution is especially useful when refining or troubleshooting parts of your agent logic. It allows you to test changes incrementally, without triggering full agent runs, reducing unnecessary AI calls, token usage, and downstream activity. This makes iteration faster, more cost-efficient, and more precise when working with complex or multi-step AI workflows.\nPartial execution for AI tools is available now for all tools - making it even easier to build, test, and fine-tune AI agents in n8n.\nHow to:\nTo use this feature you can either:\nClick the Play button on the tool you want to execute directly from the canvas view.\nOpen the tool’s Node Details View and select \"Execute Step\" to run it from there.\nIf you have previously run the workflow, the input and output will be prefilled with data from the last execution.

You can now filter insights over a variety of time periods, from the last 24 hours up to 1 year. Pro users are limited to 7 day and 14 day views.\nHourly granularity. Drill down into the last 24 hours of production executions with hourly granularity, making it easier to analyze workflows and quickly identify issues.\nThese updates provide deeper visibility into workflow history, helping you uncover trends over longer periods and detect problems sooner with more precise reporting.\n!Filter insights\nFilter insights\nContributors\nStamsy\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.91.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-05-05\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.90.3\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-05-05\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.91.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-05-01\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.91.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-28\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\nBreadcrumb view from the canvas\nWe’ve added breadcrumb navigation directly on the canvas, so you can quickly navigate to any of a workflow’s parent folders right from the canvas.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.90.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-25\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.90.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-22\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.90.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-22\nThis release contains core updates, editor updates, node updates, performance improvements, and bug fixes.\nExtended HTTP Request tool functionality\nWe’ve brought the full power of the HTTP Request node to the HTTP Request tool in AI workflows. That means your AI Agents now have access to all the advanced configuration options—like Pagination, Batching, Timeout, Redirects, Proxy support, and even cURL import.\nThis update also includes support for the $fromAI function to dynamically generate the right parameters based on the context of your prompt — making API calls smarter, faster, and more flexible than ever.\nHow to:\nOpen your AI Agent node in the canvas.\nClick the ‘+’ icon to add a new tool connection.\nIn the Tools panel, select HTTP Request Tool.\nConfigure it just like you would a regular HTTP Request node — including advanced options\n👉 Learn more about configuring the HTTP Request tool.\nScoped API keys\nUsers on the Enterprise plan can now create API keys with specific scopes to control exactly what each key can access.\n!Scoped API keys\nScoped API keys\nPreviously, API keys had full read/write access across all endpoints. While sometimes necessary, this level of access can be excessive and too powerful for most use cases.  Scoped API keys allow you to limit access to only the resources and actions a service or user actually needs.\nWhat’s new\nWhen creating a new API key, you can now:\nSelect whether the key has read, write, or both types of access.\nSpecify which resources the key can interact with.\nSupported scopes include:\nVariables — list, create, delete\nSecurity audit — generate reports\nProjects — list, create, update, delete\nExecutions — list, read, delete\nCredentials — list, create, update, delete, move\nWorkflows — list, create, update, delete, move, add/remove tags\nScoped API keys give you more control and security. You can limit access to only what’s needed, making it safer to work with third parties and easier to manage internal API usage.\nDrag and Drop in Folders\nFolders just got friendlier. With this release, you can now drag and drop workflows and folders — making it even easier to keep things tidy.\nNeed to reorganize? Just select a workflow or folder and drag it into another folder or breadcrumb location. It’s a small change that makes a big difference when managing a growing collection of workflows.\n📁 Folders are available to all registered users—jump in and get your workspace in order!\nContributors\nZordrak\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.89.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-16\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.89.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-15\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.89.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-14\nThis release contains API updates, core updates, editor updates, a new node, node updates, and bug fixes.\n### Insights\nWe're rolling out Insights, a new dashboard to monitor how your workflows are performing over time. It's designed to give admins (and owners) better visibility of their most important workflow metrics and help troubleshoot potential issues and improvements.\nIn this first release, we’re introducing a summary banner, the insights dashboard, and time saved per execution.\n#### 1. Summary banner\nA new banner on the overview page that gives instance admins and owners a birds eye view of key metrics over the last 7 days.\n!Summary banner\nInsights summary banner\nAvailable metrics:\n- Total production executions\n- Total failed executions\n- Failure rate\n- Average runtime of all workflows\n- Estimated time saved\nThis overview is designed to help you stay on top of workflow activity at a glance. It is available for all plans and editions.\n#### 2. Insights dashboard\nOn Pro and Enterprise plans, a new dashboard offers a deeper view into workflow performance and activity.\n!Insights dashboard\nInsights dashboard\nThe dashboard includes:\n- Total production executions over time, including a comparison of successful and failed executions\n- Per-workflow breakdowns of key metrics\n- Comparisons with previous periods to help spot changes in usage or behavior\n- Runtime average and failure rate over time\n#### 3. Time saved per execution\nWithin workflow settings, you can now assign a “time saved per execution” value to any workflow. This makes it possible to track the impact of your workflows and make it easier to share this visually with other teams and stakeholders.\nThis is just the beginning for Insights: the next phase will introduce more advanced filtering and comparisons, custom date ranges, and additional monitoring capabilities.\nNode updates\nWe added a credential check for the Salesforce node\nWe added SearXNG as a tool for AI agents\nYou can now search within subfolders, making it easier to find workflows across all folder levels. Just type in the search bar and go.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.88.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-10\nThis release contains new features, new nodes, performance improvements, and bug fixes.\n### Model Context Protocol (MCP) nodes\nMCP aims to standardise how LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor can interact with tools or integrate data for their agents. Many providers - both established or new - are adopting MCP as a standard way to build agentic systems. It is an easy way to either expose your own app as a server, making capabilities available to a model as tools, or as a client that can call on tools outside of your own system.\nWhile it’s still early in the development process, we want to give you access to our new MCP nodes. This will help us understand your requirements better and will also let us converge on a great general solution quicker.\nWe are adding two new nodes:\n- a MCP Server Trigger for any workflow\n- a MCP Client Tool for the AI Agent\nThe MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. You can run multiple MCP servers from your n8n instance. The MCP Client Tool connects LLMs - and other intelligent agents - to any MCP-enabled service through a single interface.\nMax from our DevRel team created an official walkthrough for you to get started:\n![Studio]()\nStudio Update #04\n### MCP Server Trigger\nThe MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. The node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools. This means your n8n workflows and integrations are now available to models run elsewhere. Pretty neat.\n!MCP Server Trigger\nMCP Server Trigger\nExplore the MCP Server Trigger docs\n### MCP Client Tool\nThe MCP Client Tool node is a MCP client, allowing you to use the tools exposed by an external MCP server. You can connect the MCP Client Tool node to your models to call external tools with n8n agents. In this regard it is similar to using a n8n tool with your AI agent. One advantage is that the MCP Client Tool can access multiple tools on the MCP server at once, keeping your canvas cleaner and easier to understand.\n!MCP Client Tool\nMCP Client Tools\nExplore the MCP Client Tool docs\nNode updates\nAdded a node for Azure Cosmos DB\nAdded a node for Milvus Vector Store\nUpdated the Email Trigger (IMAP) node\nContributors\nadina-hub\numanamente\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.87.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-09\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.86.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-09\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.87.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-08\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.87.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-04-07\nThis release contains new nodes, node updates, API updates, core updates, editor updates, and bug fixes.\nContributors\ncesars-gh\nStamsy\nPash10g\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.86.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-31\nThis release contains API updates, core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\nContributors\nAijeyomah\nownerer\nulevitsky\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.85.4\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-27\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.84.3\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-27\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.84.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-26\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.85.3\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-26\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.85.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-25\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.85.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-25\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.85.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-24\nThis release contains a new node, a new credential, core updates, editor updates, node updates, and bug fixes.\nFolders\nWhat can we say about folders? Well, they’re super handy for categorizing just about everything and they’re finally available for your n8n workflows. Tidy up your workspace with unlimited folders and nested folders. Search for workflows within folders. It’s one of the ways we’re making it easier to organize your n8n instances more effectively.\nHow to use it:\nCreate and manage folders within your personal space or within projects. You can also create workflows from within a folder. You may need to restart your instance in order to activate folders.\n!Folders\nIt's a folder alright\nFolders are available for all registered users so get started with decluttering your workspace now and look for more features (like drag and drop) to organize your instances soon.\nEnhancements to Form Trigger Node\nRecent updates to the Form Trigger node have made it a more powerful tool for building business solutions. These enhancements provide more flexibility and customization, enabling teams to create visually engaging and highly functional workflows with forms.\nHTML customization: Add custom HTML to forms, including embedded images and videos, for richer user experiences.\nCustom CSS support: Apply custom styles to user-facing components to align forms with your brand’s look and feel. Adjust fonts, colors, and spacing for a seamless visual identity.\nForm previews: Your form’s description and title will pull into previews of your form when sharing on social media or messaging apps, providing a more polished look.\nHidden fields: Use query parameters to add hidden fields, allowing you to pass data—such as a referral source—without exposing it to the user.\nNew responses options: Respond to user submissions in multiple ways including text, HTML, or a downloadable file (binary format). This enables forms to display rich webpages or deliver digital assets such as dynamically generated invoices or personalized certificates.\n!Form with custom CSS applied\nForm with custom CSS applied\nThese improvements elevate the Form Trigger node beyond a simple workflow trigger, transforming it into a powerful tool for addressing use cases from data collection and order processing to custom content creation.\nContributors\nFank\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.84.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-18\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.84.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-17\nThis release contains a new node, node updates, editor updates, and bug fixes.\nContributors\nPash10g\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.83.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-14\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.82.4\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-14\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.82.3\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-13\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.83.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-12\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.83.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-12\nThis release contains bug fixes and an editor update.\nSchema Preview\nSchema Preview lets you view and work with a node’s expected output without executing it or adding credentials, keeping you in flow while building.\nSee expected node outputs instantly. View schemas for over 100+ nodes to help you design workflows efficiently without extra steps.\nDefine workflow logic first, take care of credentials later. Build your end-to-end workflow without getting sidetracked by credential setup.\nAvoid unwanted executions when building. Prevent unnecessary API calls, unwanted data changes, or potential third-party service costs by viewing outputs without executing nodes.\nHow to use it:\nAdd a node with Schema Preview support to your workflow.\nOpen the next node in the sequence - Schema Preview data appears in the Node Editor where you would typically find it in the Schema View.\nUse Schema Preview fields just like other schema data - drag and drop them into parameters and settings as needed.\nDon’t forget to add the required credentials before putting your workflow into production.\nContributors\npemontto\nHaru922\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.82.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-12\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.82.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-04\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.82.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2025-03-03\nThis release contains core updates, editor updates, new nodes, node updates, new credentials, credential updates, and bug fixes.\nTidy up\nTidy up instantly aligns nodes, centers stickies, untangles connections, and brings structure to your workflows.

This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.\n!Task runners overview\nTask runners overview\nOur benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.\nThe Task runner comes in two modes:\n- Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes\n- External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security\nCurrently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using environment variables. Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.\nTo start using Task runners today, check out the docs.\nNode updates\nAI Transform node: We improved the prompt for code generation to transform data\nCode node: We added a warning if pairedItem is absent or could not be auto mapped\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.70.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-12-04\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.70.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-11-29\nThis release contains bug fixes.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.70.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-11-27\nThis release contains node updates, performance improvements and bug fixes.\nNew canvas in beta\nThe new canvas is now the default setting for all users.

You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. Start the workflow with a n8n Form Trigger.\n!A multi-page form with branching\nA multi-page form with branching\nAdditionally you can:\n- Set default selections with query parameters\n- Define the form with a JSON array of objects\n- Show a completion screen and redirect to another URL\nNode updates\nNew nodes:\nGoogle Business Profile and Google Business Profile Trigger: Use these to integrate Google Business Profile reviews and posts with your workflows\nEnhanced nodes:\nAI Agent: Removed the requirement to add at least one tool\nGitHub: Added workflows as a resource operation\nStructured Output Parser: Added more user-friendly error messages\nFor additional security, we improved how we handle multi-factor authentication, hardened config file permissions and introduced JWT for the public API.\nFor better performance, we improved how partial executions are handled in loops.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nContributors\nIdan Fishman\nn8n@1.64.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-24\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.64.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-21\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.64.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-16\nThis release contains a new node, node enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes.\n### Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates\nThe Remove Duplicates node got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations:\n- Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates\n- Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.\nThis makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by id or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their order date. The great thing is, you can now do this within **and across** workflow runs.\nNew node: Gong\nThe new node for Gong allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nContributors\nSören Uhrbach\nn8n@1.63.4\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-15\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.62.6\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-15\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.63.3\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-15\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.63.2\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-11\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.62.5\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-11\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.63.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-11\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.62.4\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-11\nThis release contains a bug fix.\nFor full release details, refer to Releases on GitHub.\nn8n@1.63.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2024-10-09\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.\nNode updates\nOpenAI: Added the option to choose between the default memory connector to provide memory to the assistant or to specify a thread ID\nGmail and Slack: Added custom approval operations to have a human in the loop of a workflow\nWe have also optimized the worker health checks (see breaking change above).\nEach credential now has a seperate url you can link to.

This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n.\nBoth of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before.\nNode updates\nGoogle BigQuery: Added option to return numeric values as integers and not strings\nHTTP Request: Added credential support for Sysdig\nInvoice Ninja: Additional query params for getAll requests\nQuestion and Answer Chain: Added the option to use a custom prompt\nDrag and drop insertion on cursor position from schema view is now also enabled for code, SQL and Html fields in nodes.\nCustomers with an enterprise license can now rate, tag and highlight execution data in the executions view.

    "content": "Sustainable Use License\nn8n's Sustainable Use License and n8n Enterprise License are based on the fair-code model.\nLicense FAQs\nWhat license do you use?\nn8n uses the Sustainable Use License and n8n Enterprise License. These licenses are based on the fair-code model.\nWhat source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License?\nThe Sustainable Use License applies to all our source code hosted in our main GitHub repository except:\nContent of branches other than master.\nSource code files that contain .ee. in their file name. These are licensed under the n8n Enterprise License.\nWhat is the Sustainable Use License?\nThe Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by n8n in 2022. You can read more about why we did this here. The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations:\nYou may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.\nYou may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.\nYou may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.\nWe encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us at license@n8n.io if you would like to ask any questions about it.\nWhat is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product?\nOur license restricts use to \"internal business purposes\". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:\nWhite-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money.\nHosting n8n and charging people money to access it.\nAll of the following examples are allowed under our license:\nUsing n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database.\nCreating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n.\nProviding consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n.\nSupporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server.\nCan I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app?\nUsually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data.\nHere are two examples to clarify:\nExample 1: Sync ACME app with HubSpot\nBob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot.\nNOT ALLOWED under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app.\nExample 2: Embed AI chatbot in ACME app\nBob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot.\nALLOWED under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected.\nWhat if I want to use n8n for something that's not permitted by the license?\nYou must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n Embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it here.\nIf you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at the examples, and if you're still unclear, email us at license@n8n.io.\nWhy don't you use an open source license?\nn8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable software at scale long-term.\nWhy did you create a license?\nCreating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license:\nBy using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible.\nBy promoting fair-code with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.\nOur goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were:\nTo be as permissive as possible.\nSafeguarding our ability to build a business.\nBeing as clear as possible what use was permitted or not.\nMy company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use – can I still use n8n?\nProvided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at the examples, and if you're still unclear, email us at license@n8n.io.\nWhat happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License?\nAny code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's terms of use. In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.\nn8n asks every contributor to sign our Contributor License Agreement. In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).\nIt's easy to get started contributing code to n8n here, and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community here.\nWhy did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?\nn8n was licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause until 17 March 2022. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license.\nHowever, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that's open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction.\nWe created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product.\nWhat are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?\nThere are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to \"sell\" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether.\nThat means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here.\nIs n8n open source?\nAlthough n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the Open Source Initiative (OSI), open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.\nWe coined the term 'fair-code' as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code.\nWhat is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?\nFair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software:\nIs generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody.\nHas its source code openly available.\nCan be extended by anybody in public and private communities.\nIs commercially restricted by its authors.\nThe Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses here.\nWe're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code, and other principles around sharing code with interested parties. To get in touch to chat, email license@n8n.io.\nCan I use n8n's Sustainable Use License for my own project?\nYes! We're excited to see more software use the Sustainable Use License. We'd love to hear about your project if you're using our license: license@n8n.io."

    "content": "Build an AI chat agent with n8n\nWelcome to the introductory tutorial for building AI workflows with n8n. Whether you have used n8n before, or this is your first time, we will show you how the building blocks of AI workflows fit together and construct a working AI-powered chat agent which you can easily customize for your own purposes.\n!\"Screenshot of the completed workflow\"\nMany people find it easier to take in new information in video format. This tutorial is based on one of n8n's popular videos, linked below. Watch the video or read the steps here, or both!\nWhat you will need\nn8n: For this tutorial we recommend using the n8n cloud service - there is a free trial for new users! For a self hosted service, refer to the installation pages.\nCredentials for a chat model: This tutorial uses OpenAI, but you can easily use DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Groq, Azure, and others (see the sub-nodes documentation for more).\nWhat you will learn\nAI concepts in n8n\nHow to use the AI Agent node\nWorking with Chat input\nConnecting with AI models\nCustomising input\nObserving the conversation\nAdding persistence\nAI concepts in n8n\nIf you're already familiar with AI, feel free to skip this section. This is a basic introduction to AI concepts and how they can be used in n8n workflows.\nAn AI agent builds on Large Language Models (LLMs), which generate text based\non input by predicting the next word. While LLMs only process input to produce\noutput, AI agents add goal-oriented functionality. They can use tools, process\ntheir outputs, and make decisions to complete tasks and solve problems.\nIn n8n, the AI agent is represented as a node with some extra connections.\nTABLE_PLACEHOLDER_0\nBy incorporating the AI agent as a node, n8n can combine AI-driven steps with traditional programming for efficient, real-world workflows. For instance, simpler tasks, like validating an email address, do not require AI, whereas a complex tasks, like processing the content of an email or dealing with multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio), are excellent uses of an AI agent.\n1. Create a new workflow\n2. Add a trigger node\nEvery workflow needs somewhere to start. In n8n these are called 'trigger nodes'. For this workflow, we want to start with a chat node.\nSelect Add first step or press ++tab++ to open the node menu.\nSearch for Chat Trigger. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\nSelect Chat Trigger to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.\nClose the node details view (Select Back to canvas) to return to the canvas.\n??? explanation \"More about the Chat Trigger node...\"\nThe trigger node generates output when there is an event causing it to trigger. In this case we want to be able to type in text to cause the workflow to run. In production, this trigger can be hooked up to a public chat interface as provided by n8n or embedded into another website. To start this simple workflow we will just use the built-in local chat interface to communicate, so no further setup is required.\n3. Add an AI Agent Node\nThe AI Agent node is the core of adding AI to your workflows.\nSelect the Add node !Add node icon{.off-glb} connector on the trigger node to bring up the node search.\nStart typing \"AI\" and choose the AI agent node to add it.\nThe editing view of the AI agent will now be displayed.\nThere are some fields which can be changed. As we're using the Chat Trigger node, the default setting for the source and specification of the prompt don't need to be changed.\n4. Configure the node\nAI agents require a chat model to be attached to process the incoming prompts.\nAdd a chat model by clicking the plus !Add node icon{.off-glb} button underneath the Chat Model connection on the AI Agent node (it's the first connection along the bottom of the node).\nThe search dialog will appear, filtered on 'Language Models'. These are the models with built-in support in n8n. For this tutorial we will use OpenAI Chat Model.\nSelecting the OpenAI Chat model from the list will attach it to the AI Agent node and open the node editor. One of the parameters which can be changed is the 'Model'. Note that for the basic OpenAI accounts, only the 'gpt-4o-mini' model is allowed.\n??? explanation \"Which chat model?\"\nAs mentioned earlier, the LLM is the component which generates the text according to a prompt it is given. LLMs have to be created and trained, usually an intensive process. Different LLMS may have different capabilities or specialties, depending on the data they were trained with.\n5. Add credentials (if needed)\nIn order for n8n to communicate with the chat model, it will need some credentials (login data giving it access to an account on a different online service). If you already have credentials set up for OpenAI, these should appear by default in the credentials selector. Otherwise you can use the Credentials selector to help you add a new credential.\n!image showing the credentials dialog for OpenAI\nTo add a new credential, click on the text which says 'Select credential'. An option to add a new credential will appear\n!Screenshot showing create a new credential button\nThis credential just needs an API key. When adding credentials of any type, check the text to the right-hand side. In this case it has a handy link to take you straight to your OpenAI account to retrieve the API key.\nThe API key is just one long string. That's all you need for this particular credential. Copy it from the OpenAI website and paste it into the API key section.\n??? explanation \"Keeping your credentials safe\"\nCredentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.\n6. Test the node\nNow that the node is connected to the Chat Trigger and a chat model, we can test this part of the workflow.\nClick on the 'Chat' button near the bottom of the canvas. This opens up a local chat window on the left and the AI agent logs on the right.\nType in a message and press ++enter++. You will now see the response from the chat model appear below your message.\nThe log window displays the inputs to and outputs from the AI Agent.\n!image showing a chat session in progress\n??? explanation \"Accessing the logs...\"\nYou can access the logs for the AI node even when you aren't using the chat interface. Open up the AI Agent node and click on the Logs tab in the right hand panel.\n!screenshot showing the Logs tab in the AIAgent\n7. Changing the prompt\nThe logs in the previous step reveal some extra data - the system prompt. This is the default message that the AI Agent primes the chat model with. From the log you can see this is set to \"You are a helpful assistant\". We can however change this prompt to alter the behavior of the chat model.\nOpen the AI Agent node. In the bottom of the panel is a section labeled 'Options' and a selector labeled 'Add Option'. Use this to select 'System message'\nThe system message is now displayed. This is the same priming prompt we noticed before in the logs. Change the prompt to something else to prime the chat model in a different way. You could try something like \"You are a brilliant poet who always replies in rhyming couplets\" for example.\nClose the node and return to the chat window. Repeat your message and notice how the output has changed.\n!image showing changed text for chat, now it rhymes; if you can believe that\n8. Adding persistence\nThe chat model is now giving us useful output, but there is something wrong with it which will become apparent when you try to have a conversation.\nUse the chat and tell the chat model your name, for example \"Hi there, my name is Nick\".\nWait for the response, then type the message \"What's my name?\". The AI will not be able to tell you, however apologetic it may seem. The reason for this is we are not saving the context. The AI Agent has no memory.\n!image showing a conversation illustrating the above\nIn order to remember what has happened in the conversation, the AI Agent needs to preserve context. We can do this by adding memory to the AI Agent node. On the canvas click on the !Add node icon{.off-glb} on the bottom of the AI Agent node labeled \"Memory\".\nFrom the panel which appears, select \"Simple Memory\". This will use the memory from the instance running n8n, and is usually sufficient for simple usage. The default value of 5 interactions should be sufficient here, but remember where this option is if you may want to change it later.\nRepeat the exercise of having a conversation above, and see that the AI Agent now remembers your name.\n9. Saving the workflow\nBefore we leave the workflow editor, remember to save the workflow or all your changes will be lost.\nClick on the \"Save\" button in the top right of the editor window. Your workflow will now be saved and you can return to it later to chat again or add new features.\nCongratulations!\nYou have taken your first steps in building useful and effective workflows with AI. In this tutorial we have investigated the basic building blocks of an AI workflow, added an AI Agent and a chat model, and adjusted the prompt to get the kind of output we wanted. We also added memory so the chat could retain context between messages.\nNext steps\nNow you have seen how to create a basic AI workflow, there are plenty of resources to build on that knowledge and plenty of examples to give you ideas of where to go next:\nLearn more about AI concepts and view examples in Examples and concepts.\nBrowse AI Workflow templates.\nFind out how to enhance the AI agent with tools."

    "content": "RAG in n8n\nWhat is RAG\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that improves AI responses by combining language models with external data sources. Instead of relying solely on the model's internal training data, RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge. RAG workflows typically rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.\nWhat is a vector store?\nA vector store is a special database designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors: numerical representations of text, images, or other data. When you upload a document, the vector store splits it into chunks and converts each chunk into a vector using an embedding model.\nYou can query these vectors using similarity searches, which construct results based on semantic meaning, rather than keyword matches. This makes vector stores a powerful foundation for RAG and other AI systems that need to retrieve and reason over large sets of knowledge.\nHow to use RAG in n8n\nInserting data into your vector store\nBefore your agent can access custom knowledge, you need to upload that data to a vector store:\nAdd the nodes needed to fetch your source data.\nInsert a Vector Store node (e.g. the Simple Vector Store) and choose the Insert Documents operation.\nSelect an embedding model, which converts your text into vector embeddings. Consult the FAQ for more information on choosing the right embedding model.\nAdd a Default Data Loader node, which splits your content into chunks. You can use the default settings or define your own chunking strategy:\nCharacter Text Splitter: splits by character length.\nRecursive Character Text Splitter: recursively splits by Markdown, HTML, code blocks or simple characters (recommended for most use cases).\nToken Text Splitter: splits by token count.\n(Optional) Add metadata to each chunk to enrich the context and allow better filtering later.\nQuerying your data\nYou can query the data in two main ways: using an agent or directly through a node.\nUsing agents\nAdd an agent to your workflow.\nAdd the vector store as a tool and give it a description to help the agent understand when to use it:\nSet the limit to define how many chunks to return.\nEnable Include Metadata to provide extra context for each chunk.\nAdd the same embedding model you used when inserting the data.\nUsing the node directly\nAdd your vector store node to the canvas and choose the Get Many operation.\nEnter a query or prompt:\nSet a limit for how many chunks to return.\nEnable Include Metadata if needed.\nFAQs\nHow do I choose the right embedding model?\nThe right embedding model differs from case to case.\nIn general, smaller models (for example, text-embedding-ada-002) are faster and cheaper and thus ideal for short, general-purpose documents or lightweight RAG workflows. Larger models (for example, text-embedding-3-large) offer better semantic understanding. These are best for long documents, complex topics, or when accuracy is critical.\nWhat is the best text splitting for my use case?\nThis again depends a lot on your data:\nSmall chunks (for example, 200 to 500 tokens) are good for fine-grained retrieval.\nLarge chunks may carry more context but can become diluted or noisy.\nUsing the right overlap size is important for the AI to understand the context of the chunk. That's also why using the Markdown or Code Block splitting can often help to make chunks better.\nAnother good approach is to add more context to it (for example, about the document where the chunk came from).

At this stage of workflow development, looking over workflow outputs for each example is often enough. The benefits of setting up more formal scoring or metrics don't yet justify the effort.\nLight evaluation allows you to run the examples in a test dataset through your workflow one-by-one, writing the outputs back to your dataset. You can then examine those outputs next to each other, and visually compare them to the expected outputs (if you have them).\nHow it works\nLight evaluations take place in the 'Editor' tab of your workflow, although you’ll find instructions on how to set it up in the 'Evaluations' tab.\nSteps:\nCreate a dataset\nWire the dataset up to the workflow\nWrite workflow outputs back to dataset\nRun evaluation\nThe following explanation will use a sample workflow that assigns a category and priority to incoming support tickets.\n!Example AI workflow\n1.

    "content": "Metric-based evaluations\nWhat are metric-based evaluations?\nOnce your workflow is ready for deployment, you often want to test it on more examples than when you were building it.\nFor example, when production executions start to turn up edge cases, you want to add them to your test dataset so that you can make sure they're covered.\nFor large datasets like the ones built from production data, it can be hard to get a sense of performance just by eyeballing the results. Instead, you must measure performance. Metric-based evaluations can assign one or more scores to each test run, which you can compare to previous runs. Individual scores get rolled up to measure performance on the whole dataset.\nThis feature allows you to run evaluations that calculate metrics, track how those metrics change between runs and drill down into the reasons for those changes.\nMetrics can be deterministic functions (such as the distance between two strings) or you can calculate them using AI. Metrics often involve checking how far away the output is from a reference output (also called ground truth). To do so, the dataset must contain that reference output. Some evaluations don't need this reference output though (for example, checking text for sentiment or toxicity).\nHow it works\nSet up light evaluation\nCalculate metrics\nWrite metrics back to evaluation\nRun evaluation and view results\n1. Set up light evaluation\nFollow the setup instructions to create a dataset and wire it up to your workflow, writing outputs back to the dataset.\nThe following steps use the same support ticket classification workflow from the light evaluation docs:\n!Light evaluation workflow\n2. Calculate metrics\nMetrics are dimensions used to score the output of your workflow. They often compare the actual workflow output with a reference output. It's common to use AI to calculate metrics, although it's sometimes possible to just use code. In n8n, metrics are always numbers.\nYou need to add the logic to calculate the metrics for your workflow, at a point after it has produced the outputs. You can add any reference outputs your metric uses as a column in your dataset. This makes sure they it will be available in the workflow, since they will be output by the evaluation trigger.\nExamples:\nCorrectness: whether the output's meaning is consistent with a reference output.\nCategorization: whether the output exactly matches the expected output.\nHelpfulness: whether the answer addresses the question.\nString similarity: how close the output is to a reference output, measured character-by-character.\nTool calling: whether the agent called the right tool.\nRAG document relevance: when working with a vector database, whether the documents retrieved are relevant to the question.\nRAG answer groundedness: when working with a vector database, whether the answer is \"grounded\" in the documents retrieved.\nCalculating metrics can add latency and cost, so you may only want to do it when running an evaluation and avoid it when making a production execution. You can do this by putting the metric logic after a 'check if evaluating' operation.\n!Check if evaluating node\n3. Write metrics back to evaluation\nn8n needs to know how to extract the metrics you calculated in step 2. Do this by adding an evaluation node with the 'Set metrics' operation and mapping your metrics into it.\n!Add set metrics node\nThis support ticket classification workflow shows the 'Set outputs' operation added and wired up. Since the metrics in this workflow just check whether the actual output is an exact match of the expected one, the workflow calculates them in an expression in the 'Set metrics' node rather than adding any further nodes to the workflow.\n4. Run evaluation and view results\nSwitch to the Evaluations tab on your workflow and click the Run evaluation button. An evaluation will start. Once the evaluation has finished, it will display a summary score for each metric.\nYou can see the results for each test case by clicking on the test run row. Clicking on an individual test case will open the execution that produced it (in a new tab)."

    "content": "Overview\nWhat are evaluations?\nEvaluation is a crucial technique for checking that your AI workflow is reliable. It can be the difference between a flaky proof of concept and a solid production workflow. It's important both in the building phase and after deploying to production.\nThe foundation of evaluation is running a test dataset through your workflow. This dataset contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a sample input for your workflow, and often includes the expected output(s) too.\nEvaluation allows you to:\nTest your workflow over a range of inputs so you know how it performs on edge cases\nMake changes with confidence without inadvertently making things worse elsewhere\nCompare performance across different models or prompts\nThe following video explains what evaluations are, why they're useful, and how they work:\nWhy is evaluation needed?\nAI models are fundamentally different than code. Code is deterministic and you can reason about it. This is difficult to do with LLMs, since they're black boxes. Instead, you must measure LLM output by running data through them and observing the output.\nYou can only build confidence that your model performs reliably after you have run it over multiple inputs that accurately reflect all the edge cases that it will have to deal with in production.\nTwo types of evaluation\nLight evaluation (pre-deployment)\nBuilding a clean, comprehensive dataset is hard. In the initial building phase, it often makes sense to generate just a handful of examples. These can be enough to iterate the workflow to a releasable state (or a proof of concept). You can visually compare the results to get a sense of the workflow's quality, without setting up formal metrics.\nMetric-based evaluation (post-deployment)\nOnce you deploy your workflow, it's easier to build a bigger, more representative dataset from production executions. When you discover a bug, you can add the input that caused it to the dataset. When fixing the bug, it's important to run the whole dataset over the workflow again as a regression test to check that the fix hasn't inadvertently made something else worse.\nSince there are too many test cases to check individually, evaluations measure the quality of the outputs using a metric, a numeric value representing a particular characteristic. This also allows you to track quality changes between runs.\nComparison of evaluation types\nTABLE_PLACEHOLDER_0\nLearn more\nLight evaluations: Perfect for evaluating your AI workflows against hand-selected test cases during development.\nMetric-based evaluations: Advanced evaluations to maintain performance and correctness in production by using scoring and metrics with large datasets.\nTips and common issues: Learn how to set up specific evaluation use cases and work around common issues."

    "content": "Tips and common issues\nCombining multiple triggers\nIf you have another trigger in the workflow already, you have two potential starting points: that trigger and the evaluation trigger. To make sure your workflow works as expected no matter which trigger executes, you will need to merge these branches together.\n!Merging trigger branches\nLogic to merge two trigger branches together so that they have the same data format and can be referenced from a single node.\nTo do so:\nGet the data format of the other trigger:\nExecute the other trigger.\nOpen it and navigate to the JSON view of its output pane.\nClick the copy button on the right.\nRe-shape the evaluation trigger data to match:\nInsert an Edit Fields (Set) node after the evaluation trigger and connect them together.\nChange its mode to JSON.\nPaste your data into the 'JSON' field, removing the [ and ] on the first and last lines.\nSwitch the field type to Expression.\nMap in the data from the trigger by dragging it from the input pane.\nFor strings, make sure to replace the entire value (including the quotes) and add .toJsonString() to the end of the expression.\nMerge the branches using a 'No-op' node: Insert a No-op node and wire both the other trigger and the Set node up to it. The 'No-op' node just outputs whatever input it receives.\nReference the 'No-op' node outputs in the rest of the workflow: Since both paths will flow through this node with the same format, you can be sure that your input data will always be there.\nAvoiding evaluation breaking the chat\nn8n's internal chat reads the output data of the last executed node in the workflow. After adding an evaluation node with the 'set outputs' operation, this data may not be in the expected format, or even contain the chat response.\n!Add second output branch\nThe solution is to add an extra branch coming out of your agent. Lower branches execute later in n8n, which means any node you attach to this branch will execute last. You can use a no-op node here since it only needs to pass the agent output through.\nAccessing tool data when calculating metrics\nSometimes you need to know what happened in executed sub-nodes of an agent, for example to check whether it executed a tool. You can't reference these nodes directly with expressions, but you can enable the Return intermediate steps option in the agent. This will add an extra output field called intermediateSteps which you can use in later nodes:\n!Enable return intermediate steps\nMultiple evaluations in the same workflow\nYou can only have one evaluation set up per workflow. In other words, you can only have one evaluation trigger per workflow.\nEven so, you can still test different parts of your workflow with different evaluations by putting those parts in sub-workflows and evaluating each sub-workflow.\nDealing with inconsistent results\nMetrics can often have noise: they may be different across evaluation runs of the exact same workflow. This is because the workflow itself may return different results, or any LLM-based metrics might have natural variation in them.\nYou can compensate for this by duplicating the rows of your dataset, so that each row appears more than once in the dataset. Since this means that each input will effectively be running multiple times, it will smooth out any variations."

If n8n makes the feature permanent, there may be usage limits as part of your pricing tier.\nFeature limits\nThe ChatGPT implementation in n8n has the following limitations:\nThe AI writes code that manipulates data from the n8n workflow. You can't ask it to pull in data from other sources.\nThe AI doesn't know your data, just the schema, so you need to tell it things like how to find the data you want to extract, or how to check for null.\nNodes before the Code node must execute and deliver data to the Code node before you run your AI query.\nDoesn't work with large incoming data schemas.\nMay have issues if there are a lot of nodes before the code node.\nWriting good prompts\nWriting good prompts increases the chance of getting useful code back.\nSome general tips:\nProvide examples: if possible, give a sample expected output. This helps the AI to better understand the transformation or logic you’re aiming for.\nDescribe the processing steps: if there are specific processing steps or logic that should apply to the data, list them in sequence. For example: \"First, filter out all users under 18. Then, sort the remaining users by their last name.\"\nAvoid ambiguities: while the AI understands various instructions, being clear and direct ensures you get the most accurate code. Instead of saying \"Get the older users,\" you might say \"Filter users who are 60 years and above.\"\nBe clear about what you expect as the output. Do you want the data transformed, filtered, aggregated, or sorted? Provide as much detail as possible.\nAnd some n8n-specific guidance:\nThink about the input data: make sure ChatGPT knows which pieces of the data you want to access, and what the incoming data represents. You may need to tell ChatGPT about the availability of n8n's built-in methods and variables.\nDeclare interactions between nodes: if your logic involves data from multiple nodes, specify how they should interact. \"Merge the output of 'Node A' with 'Node B' based on the 'userID' property\". if you prefer data to come from certain nodes or to ignore others, be clear: \"Only consider data from the 'Purchases' node and ignore the 'Refunds' node.\"\nEnsure the output is compatible with n8n. Refer to Data structure for more information on the data structure n8n requires.\nExample prompts\nThese examples show a range of possible prompts and tasks.\nExample 1: Find a piece of data inside a second dataset\nTo try the example yourself, download the example workflow and import it into n8n.\nIn the third Code node, enter this prompt:\nThe slack data contains only one item.

For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to Luxon's documentation.\nn8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon makes this easier.\nVariables\nn8n uses Luxon to provide two custom variables:\nnow: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to DateTime.now().\ntoday: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).\nNote that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string. This is the same behavior as Luxon's DateTime.now().\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\n=== \"Code node (Python)\"\nn8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to Data transformation functions | Dates for more information.\nDate and time behavior in n8n\nBe aware of the following:\nIn a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes.\nWith vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with new Date('2019-06-23'). In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23') or DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\").\nSetting the timezone in n8n\nLuxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either:\nDefault: America/New York\nA custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the GENERIC_TIMEZONE environment variable.\nA custom timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings.\nCommon tasks\nThis section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in Luxon's own documentation.\nConvert date string to Luxon\nYou can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.\nIf you have a date in a supported standard technical format:\nMost dates use fromISO(). This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\nLuxon's API documentation has more information on fromISO.\nLuxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to Parsing technical formats for details.\nIf you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format:\nUse Luxon's Ad-hoc parsing. To do this, use the fromFormat() function, providing the string and a set of tokens that describe the format.\nFor example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as 23-06-2019. You want to turn this into a Luxon object:\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\nWhen using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about Limitations. If you see unexpected results, try their Debugging guide.\nGet n days from today\nGet a number of days before or after today.\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\nFor example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date.\nIn the expressions editor, enter:\nOn the 23rd June 2019, this returns [Object: \"2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00\"].\nThis example uses n8n's custom variable $today for convenience. It's the equivalent of DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7}).\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\nFor example, you want a variable containing the date seven days before the current date.\nIn the code editor, enter:\nOn the 23rd June 2019, this returns [Object: \"2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00\"].\nThis example uses n8n's custom variable $today for convenience. It's the equivalent of DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7}).\nFor more detailed information and examples, refer to:\nLuxon's guide to math\nTheir API documentation on DateTime plus and DateTime minus\nCreate human-readable dates\nIn Get n days from today, the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as [Object: \"yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00\"] (for expressions) or yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00 (in the Code node). To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions.\nFor example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns 23/06/2019.\nThis expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format.\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\nYou can alter the format. For example:\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\nOn 23rd June 2019, this returns \"16 June 2019\".\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\nOn 23rd June 2019, this returns \"16 June 2019\".\nRefer to Luxon's guide on toLocaleString (strings for humans) for more information.\nGet the time between two dates\nTo get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration.\nFor example, get the number of months between two dates:\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\nThis returns [Object: {\"months\":1}].\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\nThis returns {\"months\":1}.\nRefer to Luxon's Diffs for more information.\nA longer example: How many days to Christmas?\nThis example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation.\nThe scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamlessly work for every year.\n=== \"Expressions (JavaScript)\"\nThis outputs \"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!\". For example, on 9th March, it outputs \"There are 291 days to Christmas!\".\nA detailed explanation of what the expression does:\n* {{: indicates the start of the expression.\n* \"There are \": a string.\n* +: used to join two strings.\n* $today.diff(): This is similar to the example in Get the time between two dates, but it uses n8n's custom $today variable.\n* DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days': this part gets the current year using $today.year, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.\n* toObject() turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns [Object: {\"days\":-<number-of-days>}]. For example, on 9th March, [Object: {\"days\":-291}].\n* .days uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our JMESpath documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.\n* .toString().substring(1) turns the number into a string and removes the -.\n* + \" days to Christmas!\": another string, with a + to join it to the previous string.\n* }}: indicates the end of the expression.\n=== \"Code node (JavaScript)\"\nThis outputs \"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!\". For example, on 9th March, it outputs \"There are 291 days to Christmas!\".\nA detailed explanation of what the code does:\n* \"There are \": a string.\n* +: used to join two strings.\n* $today.diff(): This is similar to the example in Get the time between two dates, but it uses n8n's custom $today variable.\n* DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days': this part gets the current year using $today.year, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure.

We will walk through the canvas and show you what each icon means and where to find things you will need while building workflows in n8n.\nGetting started\nBegin by setting up n8n.\nWe recommend starting with n8n Cloud, a hosted solution that doesn't require installation and includes a free trial.\nFor more details on the different ways to set up n8n, see our platforms documentation.\nOnce you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. Log in to your n8n instance. Select Overview and then Create Workflow to view the main canvas.\nIt should look like this:\nEditor UI\nEditor UI settings\nThe editor UI is the web interface where you build workflows. You can access all your workflows and credentials, as well as support pages, from the Editor UI.\nLeft-side panel\nOn the left side of the Editor UI, there is a panel which contains the core functionalities and settings for managing your workflows. Expand and collapse it by selecting the small arrow icon.\nThe panel contains the following sections:\nOverview: Contains all the workflows and credentials you have access to. During this course, create new workflows here.\nProjects: (Not available on Community edition) Projects group workflows and credentials. You can assign roles to users in a project to control what they can do in a project. A Personal project is available by default.\nAdmin Panel: n8n Cloud only. Access your n8n instance usage, billing, and version settings.\nTemplates: A collection of pre-made workflows. Great place to get started with common use cases.\nVariables: Used to store and access fixed data across your workflows. This feature is available on the Pro and Enterprise Plans.\nAll executions: Contains information about your workflow executions.\nHelp: Contains resources around n8n product and community.\nUpdate: (When updates are available) Indicator for any recent product updates.\nSettings: Under the ellipsis (...) menu by your username. Manage users and access settings for a variety of features.\nEditor UI left-side menu\nTop bar\nThe top bar of the Editor UI contains the following information:\nWorkflow Name: By default, n8n names a new workflow as \"My workflow\", but you can edit the name at any time.\n+ Add Tag: Tags help you organise your workflows by category, use case, or whatever is relevant for you. Tags are optional.\nInactive/active toggle: This button activates or deactivates the current workflow. By default, workflows are deactivated.\nShare: You can share and collaborate with others on workflows on the Starter, Pro, and Enterprise plans.\nSave: This button saves the current workflow.\nHistory: Once you save your workflow, you can view previous versions here.\nEditor UI top bar\nCanvas\nThe canvas is the gray dotted grid background in the Editor UI. It displays several icons and a node with different functionalities:\nButtons to zoom the canvas to fit the screen, zoom in or out of the canvas, and tidy up the nodes on screen.\nA button to Execute workflow once you add your first node. When you click on it, n8n executes all nodes on the canvas in sequence.\nA button with a + sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel.\nA button with a note icon inside. This button adds a sticky note to the canvas (visible when hovering on the top right + icon).\nA dotted square with the text \"Add first step.\" This is where you add your first node.\nWorkflow canvas\nDon't worry about workflow execution and activation for now; we'll explain these concepts later on in the course.\nNodes\nYou can think of nodes as building blocks that serve different functions that, when put together, make up a functioning machine: an automated workflow.\nBased on their function, n8n classifies nodes into four types:\nApp or Action Nodes add, remove, and edit data; request and send external data; and trigger events in other systems. Refer to the Action nodes library for a full list of these nodes.\nTrigger Nodes start a workflow and supply the initial data. Refer to the Trigger nodes library for a list of trigger nodes.\nCore Nodes can be trigger or app nodes. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Refer to the Core Nodes library for a full list of core nodes.\nCluster Nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in a workflow, primarily for AI workflows. Refer to Cluster nodes for more information.\nFinding nodes\nYou can find all available nodes in the nodes panel on the right side of the Editor UI. There are three ways in which you can open the nodes panel:\nClick the + icon in the top right corner of the canvas.\nClick the + icon on the right side of an existing node on the canvas (the node to which you want to add another one).\nClick the ++tab++ key on your keyboard.\nNodes panel\nIn the nodes panel, notice that when adding your first node, you will see the different trigger node categories. After you have added your trigger node, you'll see that the nodes panel changes to show Advanced AI, Actions in an App, Data transformation, Flow, Core, and Human in the loop nodes.\nIf you want to find a specific node, use the search input at the top of the nodes panel.\nAdding nodes\nThere are two ways to add nodes to your canvas:\nSelect the node you want in the nodes panel. The new node will automatically connect to the selected node on the canvas.\nDrag and drop the node from the nodes panel to the canvas.\nNode buttons\nIf you hover on a node, you'll notice that three icons appear on top:\nExecute the node (Play icon)\nDeactivate/Activate the node (Power icon)\nDelete the node (Trash icon)\nThere will also be an ellipsis icon, which opens a context menu containing other node options.\nSummary\nIn this lesson you learned how to navigate the Editor UI, what the icons mean, how to access the left-side and node panels, and how to add nodes to the canvas.\nIn the next lesson, you will build a mini-workflow to put into practice what you've learned so far."

Beside it, there is an info icon. If you hover on it, you'll get two more pieces of information that can provide insights into the performance of each individual node in a workflow:\nStart Time: When the node execution started.\nExecution Time: How long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing.\nJust below the Output title, you'll notice another piece of information: 10 items. This field displays the number of items (records) that the node request returned. In this example, it's expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in step 2. But if you don't set a limit, it's useful to see how many records are actually returned.\nError in nodes\n5. Save the workflow\nOnce you're finished editing the node, select Back to canvas to return to the main canvas.\nBy default, your workflow is automatically saved as \"My workflow.\"\nFor this lesson, rename the workflow to be \"Hacker News workflow.\"\nOnce you've renamed the workflow, be sure to save it.\nThere are two ways in which you can save a workflow:\nFrom the Canvas in Editor UI, click Ctrl + S or Cmd + S on your keyboard.\nSelect the Save button in the top right corner of the Editor UI. You may need to leave the node editor first by clicking outside the dialog.\nIf you see a grey Saved text instead of the Save button, your workflow was automatically saved.\nSummary\nCongratulations, you just built your first workflow!

The most annoying one's gotta be the weekly sales reporting.\nI have to collect sales data from our legacy data warehouse, which manages data from the main business processes of an organization, such as sales or production. Now, each sales order can have the status Processing or Booked. I have to calculate the sum of all the Booked orders and announce them in the company Discord every Monday. Then I have to create a spreadsheet of all the Processing sales so that the Sales Managers can review them and check if they need to follow up with customers.\nThis manual work is tough and requires high attention to detail to make sure that all the numbers are right. Inevitably, I lose my focus and mistype a number or I don't get it done on time. I've been criticized once by my manager for miscalculating the data.\nYou 👩‍🔧: Oh no! Doesn't the data warehouse have a way to export the data?\nNathan 🙋: The data warehouse was written in-house ages ago. It doesn't have a CSV export but they recently added a couple of API endpoints that expose this data, if that helps.\nYou 👩‍🔧: Perfect! That's a good start. If you have a generic API, we can add some custom code and a couple of services to make an automated workflow. This gig has n8n written all over it. Let's get started!"

Getting data from the data warehouse\nIn this part of the workflow, you will learn how to get data by making HTTP requests with the HTTP Request node.\nAfter completing this section, your workflow will look like this:\nFirst, let's set the scene for building Nathan's workflow.\nCreate new workflow\nOpen your Editor UI and create a new workflow with one of the two possible commands:\nSelect ++ctrl+alt+n++ or ++cmd+option+n++ on your keyboard.\nOpen the left menu, navigate to Workflows, and select Add workflow.\nName this new workflow \"Nathan's workflow.\"\nThe first thing you need to do is get data from ABCorp's old data warehouse.\nIn a previous chapter, you used an action node designed for a specific service (Hacker News). But not all apps or services have dedicated nodes, like the legacy data warehouse from Nathan's company.\nThough we can't directly export the data, Nathan told us that the data warehouse has a couple of API endpoints. That's all we need to access the data using the HTTP Request node in n8n.\nAdd an HTTP Request node\nNow, in your Editor UI, add an HTTP Request node like you learned in the lesson Adding nodes. The node window will open, where you need to configure some parameters.\nHTTP Request node\nThis node will use credentials.\nIn this case, you'll need the credentials for the ABCorp data warehouse API included in the email from n8n you received when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up yet, sign up here.\nIn the Parameters of the HTTP Request node, make the following adjustments:\nMethod: This should default to GET. Make sure it's set to GET.\nURL: Add the Dataset URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\nSend Headers: Toggle this control to true. In Specify Headers, ensure Using Fields Below is selected.\nHeader Parameters > Name: Enter unique_id.\nHeader Parameters > Value: The Unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\nAuthentication: Select Generic Credential Type. This option requires credentials before allowing you to access the data.\nGeneric Auth Type: Select Header Auth. (This field will appear after you select the Generic Credential Type for the Authentication.)\nCredential for Header Auth: To add your credentials, select + Create new credential. This will open the Credentials window.\nIn the Credentials window, set Name to be the Header Auth name you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\nIn the Credentials window, set Value to be the Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\nSelect the Save button in the Credentials window to save your credentials. Your Credentials Connection window should look like this:\nHTTP Request node credentials\nOnce you save, exit out of the Credentials window to return to the HTTP Request node.\nGet the data\nSelect the Execute step button in the HTTP Request node window. The table view of the HTTP request results should look like this:\nHTTP Request node output\nThis view should be familiar to you from the Building a mini-workflow page.\nThis is the data from ABCorp's data warehouse that Nathan needs to work with. This data set includes sales information from 30 customers with five columns:\norderID: The unique id of each order.\ncustomerID: The unique id of each customer.\nemployeeName: The name of Nathan's colleague responsible for the customer.\norderPrice: The total price of the customer's order.\norderStatus: Whether the customer's order status is booked or still in processing.\nWhat's next?\nNathan 🙋: This is great! You already automated an important part of my job with only one node. Now instead of manually accessing the data every time I need it, I can use the HTTP Request Node to automatically get the information.\nYou 👩‍🔧: Exactly! In the next step, I'll help you one step further and insert the data you retrieved into Airtable."

Inserting data into Airtable\nIn this step of the workflow, you will learn how to insert the data received from the HTTP Request node into Airtable using the Airtable node.\nAfter this step, your workflow should look like this:\nConfigure your table\nIf we're going to insert data into Airtable, we first need to set up a table there. To do this:\nCreate an Airtable account.\nIn your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, beginner course.\nCreate an Airtable base\nIn the beginner course base, by default, you have a table called Table 1 with four fields: Name, Notes, Assignee, and Status.  These fields aren't relevant for us since they aren't in our \"orders\" data set. This brings us to the next point: the names of the fields in Airtable have to match the names of the columns in the node result. Prepare the table by doing the following:\nRename the table from Table 1 to orders to make it easier to identify.\nDelete the 3 blank records created by default.\nDelete the Notes, Assignee, and Status fields.\nEdit the Name field (the primary field) to read orderID, with the Number field type.\nAdd the rest of the fields, and their field types, using the table below as a reference:\nTABLE_PLACEHOLDER_0\nNow your table should look like this:\nOrders table in Airtable\nNow that the table is ready, let's return to the workflow in the n8n Editor UI.\nAdd an Airtable node to the HTTP Request node\nAdd an Airtable node connected to the HTTP Request node.\nIn the node panel:\nSearch for Airtable.\nSelect Create a record from the Record Actions search results.\nThis will add the Airtable node to your canvas and open the node details window.\nIn the Airtable node window, configure the following parameters:\nCredential to connect with:\nSelect Create new credential.\nKeep the default option Connect using: Access Token selected.\nAccess token: Follow the instructions from the Airtable credential page to create your token. Use the recommended scopes and add access to your beginners course base. Save the credential and close the Credential window when you're finished.\nResource: Record.\nOperation: Create. This operation will create new records in the table.\nBase: You can pick your base from a list (for example, beginner course).\nTable: orders.\nMapping Column Mode: Map automatically. In this mode, the incoming data fields must have the same as the columns in Airtable.\nTest the Airtable node\nOnce you've finished configuring the Airtable node, execute it by selecting Execute step. This might take a moment to process, but you can follow the progress by viewing the base in Airtable.\nYour results should look like this:\nAirtable node results\nAll 30 data records will now appear in the orders table in Airtable:\nImported records in the orders table\nWhat's next?\nNathan 🙋: Wow, this automation is already so useful! But this inserts all collected data from the HTTP Request node into Airtable. Remember that I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table and calculate the price of booked orders?\nYou 👩‍🔧: Sure, no problem. As a next step, I'll use a new node to filter the orders based on their status."

Filtering Orders\nIn this step of the workflow, you will learn how to filter data using conditional logic and how to use expressions in nodes using the If node.\nAfter this step, your workflow should look like this:\nTo insert only processing orders into Airtable we need to filter our data by orderStatus. Basically, we want to tell the program that if the orderStatus is processing, then insert all records with this status into Airtable; else, for example, if the orderStatus isn't processing, calculate the sum of all orders with the other orderStatus (booked).\nThis if-then-else command is conditional logic. In n8n workflows, you can add conditional logic with the If node, which splits a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.\nAdd If node before the Airtable node\nFirst, let's add an If node between the connection from the HTTP Request node to the Airtable node:\nHover over the arrow connection the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node.\nSelect the + sign between the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node.\nConfigure the If node\nSelecting the plus removes the connection to the Airtable node to the HTTP request. Now, let's add an If node connected to the HTTP Request node:\nSearch for the If node.\nSelect it when it appears in the search.\nFor the If node, we'll use an expression.\nIn the If node window, configure the parameters:\nSet the value1 placeholder to {{ $json.orderStatus }} with the following steps:\nHover over the value1 field.\nSelect the Expression tab on the right side of the value1 field.\nNext, open the expression editor by selecting the link icon:\nOpening the Expression Editor\nUse the left-side panel to select HTTP Request >  orderStatus and drag it into the Expression field in the center of the window.\nExpression Editor in the If node\nOnce you add the expression, close the Edit Expression dialog.\nOperation: Select String > is equal to\nSet the value2 placeholder to processing.\nSelect Execute step to test the If node.\nYour results should look like this:\nIf node output\nNote that the orders with a processing order status should show for the True Branch output, while the orders with a booked order status should show in the False Branch output.\nClose the If node detail view when you're finished.\nInsert data into Airtable\nNext, we want to insert this data into Airtable. Remember what Nathan said at the end of the Inserting data into Airtable lesson?\nI actually need to insert only processing orders in the table...\nSince Nathan only needs the processing orders in the table, we'll connect the Airtable node to the If node's true connector.\nIn this case, since the Airtable node is already on our canvas, select the If node true connector and drag it to the Airtable node.\nIt's a good idea at this point to retest the Airtable node. Before you do, open your table in Airtable and delete all existing rows. Then open the Airtable node window in n8n and select Execute step.\nReview your data in Airtable to be sure your workflow only added the correct orders (those with orderStatus of processing). There should be 14 records now instead of 30.\nAt this stage, your workflow should look like this:\nWhat's next?\nNathan 🙋: This If node is so useful for filtering data! Now I have all the information about processing orders. I actually only need the employeeName and orderID, but I guess I can keep all the other fields just in case.\nYou 👩‍🔧: Actually, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Inserting more data requires more computational power, the data transfer is slower and takes longer, and takes up more storage resources in your table. In this particular case, 14 records with 5 fields might not seem like it'd make a significant difference, but if your business grows to thousands of records and dozens of fields, things add up and even one extra column can affect performance.\nNathan 🙋: Oh, that's good to know. Can you select only two fields from the processing orders?\nYou 👩‍🔧: Sure, I'll do that in the next step."

    "content": "Understanding the data structure\nIn this chapter, you will learn about the data structure of n8n and how to use the Code node to transform data and simulate node outputs.\nData structure of n8n\nIn a basic sense, n8n nodes function as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool. The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be.\nThe data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.\nData sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. The elements in this collection are called items.\nItems\nAn n8n node performs its action on each item of incoming data.\nItems in the Customer Datastore node\nCreating data sets with the Code node\nNow that you are familiar with the n8n data structure, you can use it to create your own data sets or simulate node outputs. To do this, use the Code node to write JavaScript code defining your array of objects with the following structure:\nFor example, the array of objects representing the Ninja turtles would look like this in the Code node:\nArray of objects in the Code node\nYou can also have nested pairs, for example if you want to define a primary and a secondary color. In this case, you need to further wrap the key-value pairs in curly braces {}.\nExercise\nIn a Code node, create an array of objects named myContacts that contains the properties name and email, and the email property is further split into personal and work.\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\nIn the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:\nWhen you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Result of Code node</i></figcaption></figure>\nReferencing node data with the Code node\nJust like you can use expressions to reference data from other nodes, you can also use some methods and variables in the Code node.\nPlease make sure you read these pages before continuing to the next exercise.\nExercise\nLet's build on the previous exercise, in which you used the Code node to create a data set of two contacts with their names and emails. Now, connect a second Code node to the first one. In the new node, write code to create a new column named workEmail that references the work email of the first contact.\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\nIn the Code node, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:\nWhen you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_reference.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Code node reference</i></figcaption></figure>\nTransforming data\nThe incoming data from some nodes may have a different data structure than the one used in n8n. In this case, you need to transform the data, so that each item can be processed individually.\nThe two most common operations for data transformation are:\nCreating multiple items from one item\nCreating a single item from multiple items\nThere are several ways to transform data for the purposes mentioned above:\nUse n8n's data transformation nodes. Use these nodes to modify the structure of incoming data that contain lists (arrays) without needing to use JavaScript code in the Code node:\nUse the Split Out node to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.\nUse the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.\nUse the Code node to write JavaScript functions to modify the data structure of incoming data using the Run Once for All Items mode:\nTo create multiple items from a single item, you can use JavaScript code like this. This example assumes that the item has a key named data set to an array of items in the form of: [{ \"data\": [{}, {}, ...] }]:\nTo create a single item from multiple items, you can use this JavaScript code:\nThese JavaScript examples assume your entire input is what you want to transform. As in the exercise above, you can also execute either operation on a specific field by identifying that in the items list, for example, if our workEmail example had multiple emails in a single field, we could run some code like this:\nExercise\nUse the HTTP Request node to make a GET request to the PokéAPI  (This API requires no authentication).\nTransform the data in the results field with the Split Out node.\nTransform the data in the results field with the Code node.\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n1.

The dates and times can be passed in different formats, for example:\nDATE: March 29 2022, 29-03-2022, 2022/03/29\nTIME: 08:30:00, 8:30, 20:30\nDATETIME: 2022/03/29 08:30:00\nTIMESTAMP: 1616108400 (Unix timestamp), 1616108400000 (Unix ms timestamp)\nYEAR: 2022, 22\nThere are a few ways you can work with dates and times:\nUse the Date & Time node to convert date and time data to different formats and calculate dates.\nUse Schedule Trigger node to schedule workflows to run at a specific time, interval, or duration.\nSometimes, you might need to pause the workflow execution. This might be necessary if you know that a service doesn't process the data instantly or it's slow to return all the results. In these cases, you don't want n8n to pass incomplete data to the next node.\nIf you run into situations like this, use the Wait node after the node that you want to delay. The Wait node pauses the workflow execution and will resume execution:\nAt a specific time.\nAfter a specified time interval.\nOn a webhook call.\nDate Exercise\nBuild a workflow that adds five days to an input date from the Customer Datastore node that you used before. Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before setting the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes.\nTo begin:\nAdd the Customer Datastore (n8n training) node with the Get All People action selected. Return All.\nAdd the Date & Time node to Round Up the created Date from the datastore to End of Month. Output this to field new-date. Include all input fields.\nAdd the If node to check if that new rounded date is after 1960-01-01 00:00:00.\nAdd the Wait node to the True output of that node and set it to wait for one minute.\nAdd the Edit Fields (Set) node to set a new field called outputValue to a String containing new-date. Include all input fields.\nAdd the Schedule Trigger node at the beginning of the workflow to trigger it every 30 minutes. (You can keep the Manual Trigger node for testing!)\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n1.

See Export and import workflows for more information.\nBinary data\nUp to now, you have mainly worked with text data. But what if you want to process data that's not text, like images or PDF files? These types of files are represented in the binary numeral system, so they're considered binary data. In this form, binary data doesn't offer you useful information, so you'll need to convert it into a readable form.\nIn n8n, you can process binary data with the following nodes:\nHTTP Request to request and send files from/to web resources and APIs.\nRead/Write Files from Disk to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.\nConvert to File to take input data and output it as a file.\nExtract From File to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.\nTo read or write a binary file, you need to write the path (location) of the file in the node's File(s) Selector parameter (for the Read operation) or in the node's File Path and Name parameter (for the Write operation).\nBinary Exercise 1\nFor our first binary exercise, let's convert a PDF file to JSON:\nMake an HTTP request to get this PDF file:\nUse the Extract From File node to convert the file from binary to JSON.\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\nIn the **HTTP Request node**, you should see the PDF file, like this:\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_binarydata_httprequest_file.png\" alt=\"HTTP Request node to get PDF\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>HTTP Request node to get PDF</i></figcaption></figure>\nWhen you convert the PDF from binary to JSON using the **Extract From File node**, the result should look like this:\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_binarydata_movedata_btoj.png\" alt=\"Extract From File node\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Extract From File node</i></figcaption></figure>\nTo check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:\nBinary Exercise 2\nFor our second binary exercise, let's convert some JSON data to binary:\nMake an HTTP request to the Poetry DB API\nConvert the returned data from JSON to binary using the Convert to File node.\nWrite the new binary file data to the machine where n8n is running using the Read/Write Files From Disk node.\nTo check that it worked out, use the Read/Write Files From Disk node to read the generated binary file.\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\nThe workflow for this exercise looks like this:\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_binarydata.png\" alt=\"Workflow for moving JSON to binary data\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow for moving JSON to binary data</i></figcaption></figure>\nTo check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:"

This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another.\nIn n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the Merge node, which provides several merging options:\nAppend\nCombine\nMerge by Fields: requires input fields to match on\nMerge by Position\nCombine all possible combinations\nChoose Branch\nNotice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the Merge node, they're called Input 1 Field and Input 2 Field.\nProperty Input fields in the Merge node\nMerge Exercise\nBuild a workflow that merges data from the Customer Datastore node and Code node.\nAdd a Merge node that takes Input 1 from a Customer Datastore node and Input 2 from a Code node.\nIn the Customer Datastore node, run the operation Get All People.\nIn the Code node, create an array of two objects with three properties: name, language, and country, where the property country has two sub-properties code and name.\nFill out the values of these properties with the information of two characters from the Customer Database.\nFor example, Jay Gatsby's language is English and country name is United States.\nIn the Merge node, try out different merge options.\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\nThe workflow for this exercise looks like this:\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/exercise_merge.png\" alt=\"Workflow exercise for merging data\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Workflow exercise for merging data</i></figcaption></figure>\nIf you merge data with the option **Keep Matches** using the name as the input fields to match, the result should look like this (note this example only contains Jay Gatsby; yours might look different depending on which characters you selected):\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/exercise_merge_kkm.png\" alt=\"Output of Merge node with option to keep matches\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Output of Merge node with option to keep matches</i></figcaption></figure>\nTo check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:\nLooping\nIn some cases, you might need to perform the same operation on each element of an array or each data item (for example sending a message to every contact in your address book). In technical terms, you need to iterate through the data (with loops).\nn8n generally handles this repetitive processing automatically, as the nodes run once for each item, so you don't need to build loops into your workflows.\nHowever, there are some exceptions of nodes and operations that will require you to build a loop into your workflow.\nTo create a loop in an n8n workflow, you need to connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node, and add an If node to check when to stop the loop.\nSplitting data in batches\nIf you need to process large volumes of incoming data, execute the Code node multiple times, or avoid API rate limits, it's best to split the data into batches (groups) and process these batches.\nFor these processes, use the Loop Over Items node. This node splits input data into a specified batch size and, with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data.\nLoop/Batch Exercise\nBuild a workflow that reads the RSS feed from Medium and dev.to. The workflow should consist of three nodes:\nA Code node that returns the URLs of the RSS feeds of Medium () and dev.to ().\nA Loop Over Items node with Batch Size: 1, that takes in the inputs from the Code node and RSS Read node and iterates over the items.\nAn RSS Read node that gets the URL of the Medium RSS feed, passed as an expression: {{ $json.url }}.\nThe RSS Read node is one of the exception nodes which processes only the first item it receives, so the Loop Over Items node is necessary for iterating over multiple items.\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\n1. Add a **Code Node**. You can format the code in several ways, one way is:\n- Set **Mode** to Run Once for All Items.\n- Set **Language** to JavaScript.\n- Copy the code below and paste it into the JavaScript Code editor:\n2. Add a **Loop Over Items node** connected to the **Code node**.\n- Set **Batch Size** to 1.\n3. The **Loop Over Items node** automatically adds a node called \"Replace Me\".

    "content": "Dealing with errors in workflows\nSometimes you build a nice workflow, but it fails when you try to execute it. Workflow executions may fail for a variety of reasons, ranging from straightforward problems with incorrectly configuring a node or a failure in a third-party service to more mysterious errors.\nBut don't panic. In this lesson, you'll learn how you can troubleshoot errors so you can get your workflow up and running as soon as possible.\nChecking failed workflows\nn8n tracks executions of your workflows.\nWhen one of your workflows fails, you can check the Executions log to see what went wrong. The Executions log shows you a list of the latest execution time, status, mode, and running time of your saved workflows.\nOpen the Executions log by selecting Executions in the left-side panel.\nTo investigate a specific failed execution from the list, select the name or the View button that appears when you hover over the row of the respective execution.\nExecutions log\nThis will open the workflow in read-only mode, where you can see the execution of each node. This representation can help you identify at what point the workflow ran into issues.\nTo toggle between viewing the execution and the editor, select the Editor | Executions button at the top of the page.\nWorkflow execution view\nCatching erroring workflows\nTo catch failed workflows, create a separate Error Workflow with the Error Trigger node. This workflow will only execute if the main workflow execution fails.\nUse additional nodes in your Error Workflow that make sense, like sending notifications about the failed workflow and its errors using email or Slack.\nTo receive error messages for a failed workflow, set the Error Workflow in the Workflow Settings to an Error Workflow that uses an Error Trigger node.\nThe only difference between a regular workflow and an Error Workflow is that the latter contains an Error Trigger node. Make sure to create this node before you set this as another workflow's designated Error Workflow.\nExercise\nIn the previous chapters, you've built several small workflows. Now, pick one of them that you want to monitor and create an Error Workflow for it:\nCreate a new Error Workflow.\nAdd the Error Trigger node.\nConnect a node for the communication platform of your choice to the Error Trigger node, like Slack, Discord, Telegram, or even Gmail or a more generic Send Email.\nIn the workflow you want to monitor, open the Workflow Settings and select the new Error Workflow you just created. Note that this workflow needs to run automatically to trigger the error workflow.\n??? note \"Show me the solution\"\nThe workflow for this exercise looks like this:\n<figure><img src=\"/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/exercise_errors_errortriggernode_workflow.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:100%\"><figcaption align = \"center\"><i>Error workflow</i></figcaption></figure>\nTo check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:\nThrowing exceptions in workflows\nAnother way of troubleshooting workflows is to include a Stop and Error node in your workflow. This node throws an error. You can specify the error type:\nError Message: returns a custom message about the error\nError Object: returns the type of error\nYou can only use the Stop and Error node as the last node in a workflow."

Your requirements may vary depending on the number of users, workflows, and executions. Contact n8n for more information.\nTABLE_PLACEHOLDER_0\nCPU considerations\nn8n isn't CPU intensive so even small instances (of providers such as AWS and GCP) should be enough for most use cases. Usually, memory requirements supersede CPU requirements, so focus resources there when planning your infrastructure.\nDatabase considerations\nn8n uses its database to store credentials, past executions, and workflows.\nA core feature of n8n is the flexibility to choose a database. All the supported databases have different advantages and disadvantages, which you have to consider individually and pick the one that best suits your needs. By default n8n creates an SQLite database if no database exists at the given location.\nn8n recommends that every n8n instance have a dedicated database. This helps to prevent dependencies and potential performance degradation. If it isn't possible to provide a dedicated database for every n8n instance, n8n recommends making use of Postgres's schema feature.\nFor Postgres, the database must already exist on the DB-instance. The database user for the n8n process needs to have full permissions on all tables that they're using or creating. n8n creates and maintains the database schema.\nBest practices\nSSD storage.\nIn containerized cloud environments, ensure that the volume is persisted and mounted when stopping/starting a container. If not, all data is lost.\nIf using Postgres, don't use the tablePrefix configuration option. It will be deprecated in the near future.\nPay attention to the changelog of new versions and consider reverting migrations before downgrading.\nSet up at least the basic database security and stability mechanisms such as IP allow lists and backups.\nMemory considerations\nAn n8n instance doesn't typically require large amounts of available memory. For example an n8n Cloud instance at idle requires ~100MB. It's the nature of your workflows and the data being processed that determines your memory requirements.\nFor example, while most nodes just pass data to the next node in the workflow, the Code node creates a pre-processing and post-processing copy of the data. When dealing will large binary files, this can consume all available resources."

There are some nodes where this isn't true.\nUsing loops in n8n\nn8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node.\n!The Customer Datastore node output\nNodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would:\nConnect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node.\nConfigure the parameters.\nExecute the node.\nYou would receive five messages: one for each item.\nThis is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop.\nExecuting nodes once\nFor situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the Execute Once parameter in the Settings tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one.\nCreating loops\nn8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to Node exceptions for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items.\nLoop until a condition is met\nTo create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an IF node to check when to stop the loop.\nHere is an example workflow that implements a loop with an IF node:\n!Editor UI view of sample workflow\nLoop until all items are processed\nUse the Loop Over Items node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set Batch Size to 1.\nYou can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.\nThe Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop.\nNode exceptions\nNodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow:\nCrateDB executes once for insert and update.\nCode node in Run Once for All Items mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet.\nExecute Workflow node in Run Once for All Items mode.\nHTTP Request: you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time.\nMicrosoft SQL executes once for insert, update, and delete.\nMongoDB executes once for insert and update.\nQuestDB executes once for insert.\nRedis:\nInfo: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data.\nRSS Read executes once for the requested URL.\nTimescaleDB executes once for insert and update."

A task requester submits a task request to the broker where an available task runner can pick it up for execution.\nThe runner executes the task and submits the results to the task requester. The task broker coordinates communication between the runner and the requester.\nThe n8n instance (main and worker) acts as the broker. The Code node in this case is the task requester.\nTask runner modes\nYou can use task runners in two different modes: internal and external.\nInternal mode\nIn internal mode, the n8n instance launches the task runner as a child process. The n8n process monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner. The task runner process shares the same uid and gid as n8n.\nExternal mode\nIn external mode, an external orchestrator (for example, Kubernetes) launches the task runner instead of n8n. Typically, this means you would configure the task runner to run as a side-car container next to n8n.\n!Task runner deployed as a side-car container\nIn this mode, the orchestrator monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner container.

    "content": "Hosting n8n on Google Cloud\nThis hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Google Cloud (GCP). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.\nPrerequisites\nThe gcloud command line tool\nThe gke-gcloud-auth-plugin (install the gcloud CLI first)\nHosting options\nGoogle Cloud offers several options suitable for hosting n8n, including Cloud Run (optimized for running containers), Compute Engine (VMs), and Kubernetes Engine (containers running with Kubernetes).\nThis guide uses the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.\nMost of the steps in this guide use the Google Cloud UI, but you can also use the gcloud command line tool instead to undertake all the steps.\nCreate project\nGCP encourages you to create projects to logically organize resources and configuration. Create a new project for your n8n deployment from your Google Cloud Console: select the project dropdown menu and then the NEW PROJECT button. Then select the newly created project. As you follow the other steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct project selected.\nEnable the Kubernetes Engine API\nGKE isn't enabled by default. Search for \"Kubernetes\" in the top search bar and select \"Kubernetes Engine\" from the results.\nSelect ENABLE to enable the Kubernetes Engine API for this project.\nCreate a cluster\nFrom the GKE service page, select Clusters > CREATE. Make sure you select the \"Standard\" cluster option, n8n doesn't work with an \"Autopilot\" cluster. You can leave the cluster configuration on defaults unless there's anything specifically you need to change, such as location.\nSet Kubectl context\nThe rest of the steps in this guide require you to set the GCP instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and selecting CONNECT. The displayed code snippet shows a connection string for the gcloud CLI tool. Paste and run the code snippet in the gcloud CLI to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new gcloud cluster.\nClone configuration repository\nKubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from this repository locally. The following steps explain the file configuration and how to add your information.\nClone the repository with the following command:\nAnd change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:\nConfigure Postgres\nFor larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.\nCreate a volume for persistent storage\nTo maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read this guide for specifics, but the storage.yaml manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the allowedTopologies > matchedLabelExpressions > values key. By default, they're set to us-central.\nPostgres environment variables\nPostgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.\nThe example postgres-secret.yaml file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..\nThe postgres-deployment.yaml manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.\nConfigure n8n\nCreate a volume for file storage\nWhile not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:\nUsing nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.\nIf you want to persist manual n8n encryption keys between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.\nThe n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the volumes section of the n8n-deployment.yaml manifest.\nPod resources\nKubernetes lets you optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the resources section of the n8n-deployment.yaml and postgres-deployment.yaml files:\nThis defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:\nOptional: Environment variables\nYou can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.\nCreate an n8n-secret.yaml file. Refer to Environment variables for n8n environment variables details.\nDeployments\nThe two deployment manifests (n8n-deployment.yaml and postgres-deployment.yaml) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.\nThe manifests define the following:\nSend the environment variables defined to each application pod\nDefine the container image to use\nSet resource consumption limits with the resources object\nThe volumes defined earlier and volumeMounts to define the path in the container to mount volumes.\nScaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.\nServices\nThe two service manifests (postgres-service.yaml and n8n-service.yaml) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.\nSend to Kubernetes cluster\nSend all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:\nSet up DNS\nn8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the Services & Ingress menu item of the cluster you want to use under the Endpoints column.\nDelete resources\nRemove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:\nNext steps"

It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below.\nImplementation details\nn8n uses the LoggerProxy class, located in the workflow package. Calling the LoggerProxy.init() by passing in an instance of Logger, initializes the class before the usage.\nThe initialization process happens only once. The start.ts file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the LoggerProxy class.\nOnce the Logger implementation gets created in the cli package, it can be obtained by calling the getInstance convenience method from the exported module.\nCheck the start.ts file to learn more about how this process works.\nAdding logs\nOnce the LoggerProxy class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs.\nConvenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format Logger.('', ...meta), where meta represents any additional properties desired beyond message.\nIn the example above, we use the standard log levels described above. The message argument is a string, and meta is a data object.\nWhen creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are:\nCraft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes.\nDuplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering.\nInclude multiple IDs (for example, executionId, workflowId, and sessionId) throughout all logs.\nUse node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search.\nFront-end logs\nAs of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using Logger or LoggerProxy would yield errors in the editor-ui package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions."

While this gives you freedom, it can lead to errors when workflow executions require more memory than available. This page explains how to identify and avoid these errors.\nIdentifying out of memory situations\nn8n provides error messages that warn you in some out of memory situations. For example, messages such as Execution stopped at this node (n8n may have run out of memory while executing it).\nError messages including Problem running workflow, Connection Lost, or 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable suggest that an n8n instance has become unavailable.\nWhen self-hosting n8n, you may also see error messages such as Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory in your server logs.\nOn n8n Cloud, or when using n8n's Docker image, n8n restarts automatically when encountering such an issue. However, when running n8n with npm you might need to restart it manually.\nTypical causes\nSuch problems occur when a workflow execution requires more memory than available to an n8n instance. Factors increasing the memory usage for a workflow execution include:\nAmount of JSON data.\nSize of binary data.\nNumber of nodes in a workflow.\nSome nodes are memory-heavy: the Code node and the older Function node can increase memory consumption significantly.\nManual or automatic workflow executions: manual executions increase memory consumption as n8n makes a copy of the data for the frontend.\nAdditional workflows running at the same time.\nAvoiding out of memory situations\nWhen encountering an out of memory situation, there are two options: either increase the amount of memory available to n8n or reduce the memory consumption.\nIncrease available memory\nWhen self-hosting n8n, increasing the amount of memory available to n8n means provisioning your n8n instance with more memory. This may incur additional costs with your hosting provider.\nOn n8n cloud you need to upgrade to a larger plan.\nReduce memory consumption\nThis approach is more complex and means re-building the workflows causing the issue. This section provides some guidelines on how to reduce memory consumption. Not all suggestions are applicable to all workflows.\nIncrease old memory\nThis applies to self-hosting n8n. When encountering JavaScript heap out of memory errors, it's often useful to allocate additional memory to the old memory section of the V8 JavaScript engine. To do this, set the appropriate V8 option --max-old-space-size=SIZE either through the CLI or through the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable."

The queue mode provides the best scalability.\nHow it works\nWhen running in queue mode, you have multiple n8n instances set up, with one main instance receiving workflow information (such as triggers) and the worker instances performing the executions.\nEach worker is its own Node.js instance, running in main mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second).\nBy using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload.\nThis is the process flow:\nThe main n8n instance handles timers and webhook calls, generating (but not running) a workflow execution.\nIt passes the execution ID to a message broker, Redis, which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows the next available worker to pick them up.\nA worker in the pool picks up message from Redis.\nThe worker uses the execution ID to get workflow information from the database.\nAfter completing the workflow execution, the worker:\nWrites the results to the database.\nPosts to Redis, saying that the execution has finished.\nRedis notifies the main instance.\n!\"Diagram showing the flow of data between the main n8n instance, Redis, the n8n workers, and the n8n database\"\nConfiguring workers\nWorkers are n8n instances that do the actual work. They receive information from the main n8n process about the workflows that have to get executed, execute the workflows, and update the status after each execution is complete.\nSet encryption key\nn8n automatically generates an encryption key upon first startup. You can also provide your own custom key using environment variable if desired.\nThe encryption key of the main n8n instance must be shared with all worker and webhooks processor nodes to ensure these worker nodes are able to access credentials stored in the database.\nSet the encryption key for each worker node in a configuration file or by setting the corresponding environment variable:\nSet executions mode\nSet the environment variable EXECUTIONS_MODE to queue on the main instance and any workers using the following command.\nAlternatively, you can set executions.mode to queue in the configuration file.\nStart Redis\nTo run Redis in a Docker container, follow the instructions below:\nRun the following command to start a Redis instance:\nBy default, Redis runs on localhost on port 6379 with no password. Based on your Redis configuration, set the following configurations for the main n8n process. These will allow n8n to interact with Redis.\nTABLE_PLACEHOLDER_0"

For example, an API may limit the number of requests you can make per minute, or per day.\nAPIs can also limits how much data you can send in one request, or how much data the API sends in a single response.\nIdentify rate limit issues\nWhen an n8n node hits a rate limit, it errors. n8n displays the error message in the node output panel. This includes the error message from the service.\nIf n8n received error 429 (too many requests) from the service, the error message is The service is receiving too many requests from you.\nTo check the rate limits for the service you're using, refer to the API documentation for the service.\nHandle rate limits for integrations\nThere are two ways to handle rate limits in n8n's integrations: using the Retry On Fail setting, or using a combination of the Loop Over Items and Wait nodes:\nRetry On Fail adds a pause between API request attempts.\nWith Loop Over Items and Wait you can break you request data into smaller chunks, as well as pausing between requests.\nEnable Retry On Fail\nWhen you enable Retry On Fail, the node automatically tries the request again if it fails the first time.\nOpen the node.\nSelect Settings.\nEnable the Retry On Fail toggle.\nConfigure the retry settings: if using this to work around rate limits, set Wait Between Tries (ms) to more than the rate limit. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set Wait Between Tries (ms) to 1000 to allow a 1 second wait.\nUse Loop Over Items and Wait\nUse the Loop Over Items node to batch the input items, and the Wait node to introduce a pause between each request.\nAdd the Loop Over Items node before the node that calls the API. Refer to Loop Over Items for information on how to configure the node.\nAdd the Wait node after the node that calls the API, and connect it back to the Loop Over Items node. Refer to Wait for information on how to configure the node.\nFor example, to handle rate limits when using OpenAI:\n!\"Screenshot of a workflow using the Loop Over Items node and Wait node to handle API rate limits for the OpenAI APIs\"\nHandle rate limits in the HTTP Request node\nThe HTTP Request node has built-in settings for handling rate limits and large amounts of data.\nBatch requests\nUse the Batching option to send more than one request, reducing the request size, and introducing a pause between requests. This is the equivalent of using Loop Over Items and Wait.\nIn the HTTP Request node, select Add Option > Batching.\nSet Items per Batch: this is the number of input items to include in each request.\nSet Batch Interval (ms) to introduce a delay between requests. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set Wait Between Tries (ms) to 1000 to allow a 1 second wait.\nPaginate results\nAPIs paginate their results when they need to send more data than they can handle in a single response.

Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatever value you provide.\nIn the Query Options section, you can activate the following parameters:\nQuery lets you specify filter predicates in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: {\"status\": \"success\", \"_submission_time\": {\"$lt\": \"2021-11-01T01:02:03\"}} queries for all submissions with the value success for the field status, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03.\nFields lets you specify the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter.\nSort lets you provide a list of sorting criteria in MongoDB JSON format. For example, {\"status\": 1, \"_submission_time\": -1} specifies a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time.\nMore details about these options can be found in the Formhub API docs#api-parameters)\nSubmission options\nAll operations that return form submission data offer options to tweak the response. These include:\nDownload options lets you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images).\nFormatting options perform some reformatting as described in About reformatting.\nAbout reformatting\nThe default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.\nThis node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the Reformat? parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.\nWhen enabled, the reformatting:\nReorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a / character in the field names, for example Group1/Question1. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into Group1.Question1, as nested JSON objects.\nRenames fields to trim _ (not supported by many downstream systems).\nParses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.\nSplits all fields matching any of the Multiselect Mask wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the * wildcard.\nConverts all fields matching any of the Number Mask wildcard masks into a JSON float.\nHere's a detailed example in JSON:\nWith reformatting enabled, and the appropriate masks for multi-select and number formatting (for example, Crops_ and _sqm respectively), n8n parses it into:"

This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows.\nYou can't use this pattern for tables that use composite keys, where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's user table in the mysql database, where you need both the user and host columns to uniquely identify rows.\nTo update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the Execute SQL operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both customer_id and product_id:\nCan't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker\nWhen you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL.\nThe solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.\nIf only MySQL is in Docker\nIf only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).\nWhen running the container, publish the port with the -p flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this:\nWhen configuring MySQL credentials, the localhost address should work without a problem (set the Host to localhost).\nIf only n8n is in Docker\nIf only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 on the host.\nIf you are running n8n in Docker on Linux, use the --add-host flag to map host.docker.internal to host-gateway when you start the container. For example:\nIf you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.\nWhen configuring MySQL credentials, use host.docker.internal as the Host address instead of localhost.\nIf MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers\nIf both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.\nConfigure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same user-defined bridge network.\nWhen configuring MySQL credentials, use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of localhost. For example, if you call the MySQL container my-mysql, you would set the Host to my-mysql.\nIf MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container\nIf MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the localhost address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on localhost and configure the Host in the MySQL credentials in n8n to use localhost.\nDecimal numbers returned as strings\nBy default, the MySQL node returns DECIMAL values as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the MySQL library that n8n uses.\nTo output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the Output Decimals as Numbers option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings.\nAs an alternative, you can manually convert from the string to a decimal using the toFloat() function with toFixed() or with the Edit Fields (Set) node after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision."

    "content": "Notion node common issues\nHere are some common errors and issues with the Notion node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\nRelation property not displaying\nThe Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for two-way relations. When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's Database Page resource.\nTo enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the Show on [name of related database] option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting.\nIf you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the HTTP Request with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a PATCH request to the following URL:\nEnable Send Body, set the Body Content Type to JSON, and set Specify Body to Using JSON.  Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the JSON field:\nCreate toggle heading\nThe Notion node allows you to create headings and toggles when adding blocks to Page, Database Page, or Block resources. Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself.\nYou can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the is_toggleable property:\nAdd a heading with Notion node.\nSelect the resource you want to add a heading to:\nTo add a new page with a heading, select the Page or Database Page resources with the Create operation.\nTo add a heading to an existing page, select the Block resource with the Append After operation.\nSelect Add Block and set the Type Name or ID to either Heading 1, Heading 2, or Heading 3.\nAdd an HTTP Request node connected to the Notion node and select the GET method.\nSet the URL to  For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL:  $json.results[0].id }}. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first.\nSelect Predefined Credential Type and connect your existing Notion credentials.\nAdd an Edit Fields (Set) node after the HTTP Request node.\nAdd heading_1.is_toggleable as a new Boolean field set to true. Swap heading_1 for a different heading number as necessary.\nAdd a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node.\nSet the Method to PATCH and use  $json.id }} as the URL value.\nSelect Predefined Credential Type and connect your existing Notion credentials.\nEnable Send Body and set a parameter.\nSet the parameter Name to heading_1 (substitute heading_1 for the heading level you are using).\nSet the parameter Value to {{ $json.heading_1 }} (substitute heading_1 for the heading level you are using).\nThe above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the is_toggleable property, and update the heading block.\nHandle null and empty values\nYou may receive a validation error when working with the Notion node if you submit fields with empty or null values. This can occur any time you populate fields from previous nodes when that data is missing.\nTo work around this, check for the existence of the field data before sending it to Notion or use a default value.\nTo check for the data before executing the Notion node, use an If node to check whether the field is unset. This allows you to use the Edit Fields (Set) node to conditionally remove the field when it doesn't have a valid value.\nAs an alternative, you can set a default value if the incoming data doesn't provide one."

    "content": "Postgres node common issues\nHere are some common errors and issues with the Postgres node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\nDynamically populate SQL IN groups with parameters\nIn Postgres, you can use the SQL IN comparison construct to make comparisons between groups of values:\nWhile you can use n8n expressions in your query to dynamically populate the values in an IN group, combining this with query parameters provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input.\nTo construct an IN group query with query parameters:\nSet the Operation to Execute Query.\nIn Options, select Query Parameters.\nUse an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, {{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }}.\nIn the Query parameter, write your query with the IN construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example:\nInside of the IN parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like $1, $2, and $3) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed:\nWith this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of prepared statement placeholders for the IN values according to the number of items in your array.\nWorking with timestamps and time zones\nTo avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips:\nUse UTC when storing and passing dates: Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems.\nSet the execution timezone: Set the global timezone in n8n using either environment variables (for self-hosted) or in the settings (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the workflow settings.\nUse ISO 8601 format: The ISO 8601 format encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses Luxon to parse dates. If you need to cast to ISO 8601 explicitly, you can use the Date & Time node and a custom format set to the string yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.\nOutputting Date columns as date strings instead of ISO datetime strings\nn8n's uses the pg package to integrate with Postgres, which affects how n8n processes date, timestamp, and related types from Postgres.\nThe pg package parses DATE values into new Date(row_value) by default, which produces a date that follows the ISO 8601 datetime string format. For example, a date of 2025-12-25 might produce a datetime sting of 2025-12-25T23:00:00.000Z depending on the instance's timezone settings.\nTo work around this, use the Postgres TO_CHAR function to format the date into the expected format at query time:\nThis will produce the date as a string without the time or timezone components. To continue the earlier example, with this casting, a date of 2025-12-25 would produce the string 2025-12-25. You can find out more in the pg package documentation on dates."

Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same user-defined bridge network if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file.\nWhen configuring Supabase credentials, use the Supabase API gateway container's name (supabase-kong by default) as the host address instead of localhost. For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the Host to\nRecords are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase\nIf queries for records return empty using the Supabase node, but are available through the Postgres node or with a Postgres client, there may be a conflict with Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) policy.\nSupabase always enables RLS when you create a table in a public schema with the Table Editor. When RLS is active, the API doesn't return any data with the public anon key until you create policies. This is a security measure to ensure that you only expose data you intend to.\nTo access data from a table with RLS enabled as the anon role, create a policy to enable the access patterns you intend to use."

If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like:\nError: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel.\nTo add a bot to a channel:\nIn the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.\nLabel the channel name as public channel.\nSelect Administrators > Add Admin.\nSearch for the bot's username and select it.\nSelect the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.\nGet the Chat ID\nYou can only use @channelusername on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.\nThere are three ways to get that ID:\nFrom the Telegram Trigger: Use the Telegram Trigger node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.\nFrom your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter \"g.\" Prefix your group Chat ID with a - when you enter it in n8n.\nInvite Telegram's @RawDataBot to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a chat object. The id for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.\nSend more than 30 messages per second\nThe Telegram API has a limitation of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:\nLoop Over Items node: Use the Loop Over Items node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.\nTelegram node: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the Expression Editor to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.\nCode node: Connect the Code node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.\nYou can also use this workflow.\nRemove the n8n attribution from sent messages\nIf you're using the node to send Telegram messages, the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:\nThis message was sent automatically with n8n\nTo remove this attribution:\nIn the node's Additional Fields section, select Add Field.\nSelect Append n8n attribution.\nTurn the toggle off.\nRefer to Send Message additional fields for more information."

This is an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be\n{{ $json.chatInput }} if the input is from a chat or message source. By default, it expects a text field.\nNode options\nSentiment Categories: Define the categories that you want to classify your input as.\nBy default, these are Positive, Neutral, Negative. You can customize these categories to fit your specific use case, such as Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative for more granular analysis.\nInclude Detailed Results: When turned on, this option includes sentiment strength and confidence scores in the output. Note that these scores are estimates generated by the language model and are rough indicators rather than precise measurements.\nSystem Prompt Template: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the sentiment analysis. It uses the {categories} placeholder for the categories.\nEnable Auto-Fixing: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.\nUsage Notes\nModel Temperature Setting\nIt's strongly advised to set the temperature of the connected language model to 0 or a value close to 0. This helps ensure that the results are as deterministic as possible, providing more consistent and reliable sentiment analysis across multiple runs.\nLanguage Considerations\nThe node's performance may vary depending on the language of the input text.\nFor best results, ensure your chosen language model supports the input language.\nProcessing Large Volumes\nWhen analyzing large amounts of text, consider splitting the input into smaller chunks to optimize processing time and resource usage.\nIterative Refinement\nFor complex sentiment analysis tasks, you may need to iteratively refine the system prompt and categories to achieve the desired results.\nExample Usage\nBasic Sentiment Analysis\nConnect a data source (for example, RSS Feed, HTTP Request) to the Sentiment Analysis node.\nSet the \"Text to Analyze\" field to the relevant item property (for example, {{ $json.content }} for blog post content).\nKeep the default sentiment categories.\nConnect the node's outputs to separate paths for processing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments differently.\nCustom Category Analysis\nChange the Sentiment Categories to Excited, Happy, Neutral, Disappointed, Angry.\nAdjust your workflow to handle these five output categories.\nUse this setup to analyze customer feedback with more nuanced emotional categories.\nRelated resources"

This leads to better, more consistent results than parsing directly in the agent workflow."

Select an option in Combine By to determine how you want to merge the input data.\nMatching Fields\nCompare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in Fields to Match.\nn8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the Output Type setting:\nKeep Matches: Merge items that match. This is like an inner join.\nKeep Non-Matches: Merge items that don't match.\nKeep Everything: Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join.\nEnrich Input 1: Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2.

Refer to Clash handling for details.\nFuzzy Compare: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats \"3\" and 3 as the same.\nDisable Dot Notation: This prevents accessing child fields using parent.child in the field name.\nMultiple Matches: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.\nInclude All Matches: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.\nInclude First Match Only: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.\nInclude Any Unpaired Items: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match.\nClash Handling\nSQL Query\nWrite a custom SQL Query to merge the data.\nExample:\nData from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to AlaSQL GitHub page for a full list of supported SQL statements.\nChoose Branch\nChoose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to Output:\nThe Input 1 Data\nThe Input 2 Data\nA Single, Empty Item\nThe node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it.\nTemplates and examples\nMerging data streams with uneven numbers of items\nThe items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed.\nBranch execution with If and Merge nodes\nTry it out: A step by step example\nCreate a workflow with some example input data to try out the Merge node.\nSet up sample data using the Code nodes\nAdd a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Start node.\nPaste the following JavaScript code snippet in the JavaScript Code field:\nAdd a second Code node, and connect it to the Start node.\nPaste the following JavaScript code snippet in the JavaScript Code field:\nTry out different merge modes\nAdd the Merge node. Connect the first Code node to Input 1, and the second Code node to Input 2. Run the workflow to load data into the Merge node.\nThe final workflow should look like this:\nNow try different options in Mode to see how it affects the output data.\nAppend\nSelect Mode > Append, then select Execute step.\nYour output in table view should look like this:\nTABLE_PLACEHOLDER_0"

This includes when using expressions. You can't force looping using the Loop node: the workflow will run, but the webhook response will still only contain the results of the first execution.\nIf you need to return more than one data item, choose one of these options:\nInstead of using the Respond to Webhook node, use the When Last Node Finishes option in Respond in the Webhook node. Use this when you want to return the final data that the workflow outputs.\nUse the Aggregate node to turn multiple items into a single item before passing the data to the Respond to Webhook node.

Depending on what you're trying to achieve, you often don't need the Loop Over Items node in your workflow. You can learn more about how n8n processes multiple items on the looping in n8n page.\nThese links highlight some of the cases where the Loop Over Items node can be useful:\nLoop until all items are processed: describes how the Loop Over Items node differs from normal item processing and when you might want to incorporate this node.\nNode exceptions: outlines specific cases and nodes where you may need to use the Loop Over Items node to manually build looping logic.\nAvoiding rate limiting: demonstrates how to batch API requests to avoid rate limits from other services.\nNode parameters\nBatch Size\nEnter the number of items to return with each call.\nNode options\nReset\nIf turned on, the node will reset with the current input-data newly initialized with each loop. Use this when you want the Loop Over Items node to treat incoming data as a new set of data instead of a continuation of previous items.\nFor example, you can use the Loop Over Items node with the reset option and an If node to query a paginated service when you don't know how many pages you need in advance. The loop queries pages one at a time, performs any processing, and increments the page number. The loop reset ensures the loop recognizes each iteration as a new set of data. The If node evaluates an exit condition to decide whether to perform another iteration or not.\nWhen enabled, you can adjust the reset conditions by switching the parameter representation from Fixed to Expression. The results of your expression evaluation determine when the node will reset item processing.\nTemplates and examples\nRead RSS feed from two different sources\nThis workflow allows you to read an RSS feed from two different sources using the Loop Over Items node. You need the Loop Over Items node in the workflow as the RSS Feed Read node only processes the first item it receives. You can also find the workflow on n8n.io.\nThe example walks through building the workflow, but assumes you are already familiar with n8n. To build your first workflow, including learning how to add nodes to a workflow, refer to Try it out.\nThe final workflow looks like this:\nCopy the workflow file above and paste into your instance, or manually build it by following these steps:\nAdd the manual trigger.\nAdd the Code node.\nCopy this code into the Code node:\nAdd the Loop Over Items node.\nConfigure Loop Over Items: set the batch size to 1 in the Batch Size field.\nAdd the RSS Feed Read node.\nSelect Execute Workflow. This runs the workflow to load data into the RSS Feed Read node.\nConfigure RSS Feed Read: map url from the input to the URL field. You can do this by dragging and dropping from the INPUT panel, or using this expression: {{ $json.url }}.\nSelect Execute Workflow to run the workflow and see the resulting data.\nCheck that the node has processed all items\nTo check if the node still has items to process, use the following expression: {{$node[\"Loop Over Items\"].context[\"noItemsLeft\"]}}. This expression returns a boolean value. If the node still has data to process, the expression returns false, otherwise it returns true.\nGet the current running index of the node\nTo get the current running index of the node, use the following expression: {{$node[\"Loop Over Items\"].context[\"currentRunIndex\"];}}."

It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools.\nUnlike conventional trigger nodes, which respond to events and pass their output to the next connected node, the MCP Server Trigger node only connects to and executes tool nodes. Clients can list the available tools and call individual tools to perform work.\nYou can expose n8n workflows to clients by attaching them with the Custom n8n Workflow Tool node.\nNode parameters\nUse these parameters to configure your node.\nMCP URL\nThe MCP Server Trigger node has two MCP URLs: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.\nSelect Test URL or Production URL to toggle which URL n8n displays.\nTest: n8n registers a test MCP URL when you select Listen for Test Event or Execute workflow, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the MCP URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.\nProduction: n8n registers a production MCP URL when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the Executions tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.\nAuthentication\nYou can require authentication for clients connecting to your MCP URL. Choose from these authentication methods:\nBearer auth\nHeader auth\nRefer to the HTTP request credentials for more information on setting up each credential type.\nPath\nBy default, this field contains a randomly generated MCP URL path, to avoid conflicts with other MCP Server Trigger nodes.\nYou can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.\nTemplates and examples\nIntegrating with Claude Desktop\nYou can connect to the MCP Server Trigger node from Claude Desktop by running a gateway to proxy SSE messages to stdio-based servers.\nTo do so, add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration:\nBe sure to replace the  and  placeholders with the values from your MCP Server Trigger node parameters and credentials.\nLimitations\nConfiguring the MCP Server Trigger node with webhook replicas\nThe MCP Server Trigger node relies on Server-Sent Events (SSE) or streamable HTTP, which require the same server instance to handle persistent connections. This can cause problems when running n8n in queue mode depending on your webhook processor configuration:\nIf you use queue mode with a single webhook replica, the MCP Server Trigger node works as expected.\nIf you run multiple webhook replicas, you need to route all /mcp requests to a single, dedicated webhook replica. Create a separate replica set with one webhook container for MCP requests. Afterward, update your ingress or load balancer configuration to direct all /mcp traffic to that instance.\nRelated resources\nn8n also provides an MCP Client Tool node that allows you to connect your n8n AI agents to external tools.\nRefer to the MCP documentation and MCP specification for more details about the protocol, servers, and clients.\nCommon issues\nHere are some common errors and issues with the MCP Server Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\nRunning the MCP Server Trigger node with a reverse proxy\nWhen running n8n behind a reverse proxy like nginx, you may experience problems if the MCP endpoint isn't configured for SSE or streamable HTTP.\nSpecifically, you need to disable proxy buffering for the endpoint. Other items you might want to adjust include disabling gzip compression (n8n handles this itself), disabling chunked transfer encoding, and setting the Connection to an empty string to remove it from the forwarded headers. Explicitly disabling these in the MCP endpoint ensures they're not inherited from other places in your nginx configuration.\nAn example nginx location block for serving MCP traffic with these settings may look like this:"

    "content": "Code node common issues\nHere are some common errors and issues with the Code node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\nCode doesn't return items properly\nThis error occurs when the code in your Code node doesn't return data in the expected format.\nIn n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. Each of these objects wraps another object with the json key:\nTo troubleshoot this error, check the following:\nRead the data structure to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.\nUnderstand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with item linking.\nA 'json' property isn't an object\nThis error occurs when the Code node returns data where the json key isn't pointing to an object.\nThis may happen if you set json to a different data structure, like an array:\nTo resolve this, ensure that the json key references an object in your return data:\nCode doesn't return an object\nThis error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result.\nTo resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the expected data structure:\nThis error may also occur if the code you provided returns 'undefined' instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects.\n'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level\nThis error occurs if you try to use import or export in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the require function to load modules.\nTo resolve this issue, try changing your import statements to use require:\nCannot find module '<module>'\nThis error occurs if you try to use require in the Code node and n8n can't find the module.\nIf you're self-hosting n8n, follow these steps:\nInstall the module into your n8n environment.\nIf you are running n8n with npm, install the module in the same environment as n8n.\nIf you are running n8n with Docker, you need to extend the official n8n image with a custom image that includes your module.\nSet the NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN and NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL environment variables to allow importing modules.\nUsing global variables\nSometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.\nTo set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the static data functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes."

Details \"Understand pagination\"\nPagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.\nFor example, you make an API call to an endpoint called /users. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response.\nIf the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call /users with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.\nConfigure the pagination settings:\nPagination Mode:\nOff: Turn off pagination.\nUpdate a Parameter in Each Request: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.\nResponse Contains Next URL: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set Next URL.\nFor example setups, refer to HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination.\nn8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:\nProxy\nUse this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.\nEnter the Proxy the request should use. This takes precedence over global settings defined with the HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, or ALL_PROXY environment variables.\nTimeout\nUse this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.\nEnter the Timeout time to wait in milliseconds.\nTool-only options\nThe following options are only available when attached to an AI agent as a tool{ data-preview }.\nOptimize Response\nWhether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.\nWhen optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:\nJSON\nWhen expecting a JSON response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:\nField Containing Data: This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.\nInclude Fields: This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:\nAll: Include all fields in the response object.\nSelected: Include only the fields specified below.\nFields: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.\nExclude: Include all fields except the fields specified below.\nFields: A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.\nHTML\nWhen expecting HTML, you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:\nSelector (CSS): A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the body element by default.\nReturn Only Content: Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.\nElements To Omit: A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.\nTruncate Response: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.\nMax Response Characters: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.\nText\nWhen expecting a generic Text response, you can optimize the results with the following options:\nTruncate Response: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.\nMax Response Characters: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.\nImport curl command\ncurl is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.\nYou can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.\nImport a curl command:\nFrom the HTTP Request node's Parameters tab, select Import cURL. The Import cURL command modal opens.\nPaste your curl command into the text box.\nSelect Import. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.\nTemplates and examples\nCommon issues\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to Common Issues."

    "content": "Remove Duplicates node\nUse the Remove Duplicates node to identify and delete items that are:\nidentical across all fields or a subset of fields in a single execution\nidentical to or surpassed by items seen in previous executions\nThis is helpful in situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.\nBy comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can  delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values.\nOperation modes\nThe remove duplication node works differently depending on the value of the operation parameter:\nRemove Items Repeated Within Current Input: Identify and remove duplicate items in the current input across all fields or a subset of fields.\nRemove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates.\nClear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.\nRemove Items Repeated Within Current Input\nWhen you set the \"Operations\" field to Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input, the Remove Duplicate node identifies and removes duplicate items in the current input. It can do this across all fields, or within a subset of fields.\nRemove Items Repeated Within Current Input parameters\nWhen using the Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input operation, the following parameter is available:\nCompare: Select which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:\nAll Fields: Compares all fields of the input data.\nAll Fields Except: Enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.\nSelected Fields: Enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.\nRemove Items Repeated Within Current Input options\nIf you choose All Fields Except or Selected Fields as your compare type, you can add these options:\nDisable Dot Notation: Set whether to use dot notation to reference child fields in the format parent.child (turned off) or not (turn on).\nRemove Other Fields: Set whether to remove any fields that aren't used in the comparison (turned on) or not (turned off).\nRemove Items Processed in Previous Executions\nWhen you set the \"Operation\" field to Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions, the Remove Duplicate node compares items in the current input to items from previous executions.\nRemove Items Processed in Previous Executions parameters\nWhen using the Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions operation, the following parameters are available:\nKeep Items Where: Select how n8n decides which items to keep. The following options are available:\nValue Is New: n8n removes items if their value matches items from earlier executions.\nValue Is Higher than Any Previous Value: n8n removes items if the current value isn't higher than previous values.\nValue Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date: n8n removes date items if the current date isn't later than previous dates.\nValue to Dedupe On: The input field or fields to compare. The option you select for the Keep Items Where parameter determines the exact format you need:\nWhen using Value Is New, this must be an input field or combination of fields with a unique ID.\nWhen using Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value, this must be an input field or combination of fields that has an incremental value.\nWhen using Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date, this must be an input field that has a date value in ISO format.\nRemove Items Processed in Previous Executions options\nWhen using the Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions operation, the following option is available:\nScope: Sets how n8n stores and uses the deduplication data for comparisons. The following options are available:\nNode: (default) Stores the data for this node independently from other Remove Duplicates instances in the workflow. When you use this scope, you can clear the duplication history for this node instance without affecting other nodes.\nWorkflow: Stores the duplication data at the workflow level. This shares duplication data with any other Remove Duplicate nodes set to use \"workflow\" scope.  n8n will still manage the duplication data for other Remove Duplicate nodes set to \"node\" scope independently.\nWhen you select Value Is New as your Keep Items Where choice, this option is also available:\nHistory Size: The number of items for n8n to store to track duplicates across executions. The value of the Scope option determines whether this history size is specific to this individual Remove Duplicate node instance or shared with other instances in the workflow. By default, n8n stores 10,000 items.\nClear Deduplication History\nWhen you set the \"Operation\" field to Clear Deduplication History, the Remove Duplicates node manages and clears the stored items from previous executions. This operation doesn't affect any items in the current input. Instead, it manages the database of items that the \"Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions\" operation uses.\nClear Deduplication History parameters\nWhen using the Clear Deduplication History operation, the following parameter is available:\nMode: How you want to manage the key / value items stored in the database. The following option is available:\nClean Database: Deletes all duplication data stored in the database. This resets the duplication database to its original state.\nClear Deduplication History options\nWhen using the Clear Deduplication History operation, the following option is available:\nScope: Sets the scope n8n uses when managing the duplication database.\nNode: (default) Manages the duplication database specific to this Remove Duplicates node instance.\nWorkflow: Manages the duplication database shared by all Remove Duplicate node instances that use workflow scope.\nTemplates and examples\nFor templates using the Remove Duplicates node and examples of how to use it, refer to Templates and examples.\nRelated resources"

After activating the worfklow, you can alter a variable's value in the settings but it won't change how often the workflow runs. To work around this, you must stop and then re-activate the workflow to apply the updated variable value.\nChanging the trigger interval\nYou can update the scheduled trigger interval at any time but it only gets updated when the workflow is activated. If you change the trigger interval after the workflow is active, the changes won't take effect until you stop and then re-activate the workflow.\nAlso, the schedule begins from the time when you activate the workflow. For example, if you had originally set a schedule of every 1 hour and it should execute at 12:00, if you changed it to a 2 hour schedule and re-activated the workflow at 11:30, the next execution will be at 13:30, 2 hours from when you activated it."

Refer to the Discord Creating an App guide for more information on creating an app, especially:\nFetching your credentials for getting your app's credentials into your local developer environment.\nHandling interactivity for information on setting up public endpoints for interactive /slash commands.\nUsing OAuth2\nUse this method if you want to add the bot to Discord servers using the OAuth2 flow, which simplifies the process for those installing your app.\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\nA Client ID\nA Client Secret\nChoose whether to send Authentication in the Header or Body\nA Bot Token\nFor details on creating an application with a bot and generating the token, follow the same steps as in Using bot above.\nThen:\nCopy the Bot Token you generate and add it into the n8n credential.\nOpen the OAuth2 page in your Discord application to access your Client ID and generate a Client Secret. Add these to your n8n credential.\nFrom n8n, copy the OAuth Redirect URL and add it into the Discord application in OAuth2 > Redirects. Be sure you save these changes.\nUsing webhook\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\nA Webhook URL: Generated once you create a webhook.\nTo get a Webhook URL, you create a webhook and copy the URL that gets generated:\nOpen your Discord Server Settings and open the Integrations tab.\nSelect Create Webhook to create a new webhook.\nGive your webhook a Name that makes sense.\nSelect the avatar next to the Name to edit or upload a new avatar.\nIn the CHANNEL dropdown, select the channel the webhook should post to.\nSelect Copy Webhook URL to copy the Webhook URL. Enter this URL in your n8n credential.\nRefer to the Discord Making a Webhook documentation for more information.\nChoose an authentication method\nThe simplest installation is a webhook. You create and add webhooks to a single channel on a Discord server. Webhooks can post messages to a channel. They don't require a bot user or authentication. But they can't listen or respond to user requests or commands. If you need a straightforward way to send messages to a channel without the need for interaction or feedback, use a webhook.\nA bot is an interactive step up from a webhook. You add bots to the Discord server (referred to as a guild in the Discord API documentation) or to user accounts. Bots added to the server can interact with users on all the server's channels. They can manage channels, send and retrieve messages, retrieve the list of all users, and change their roles. If you need to build an interactive, complex, or multi-step workflow, use a bot.\nOAuth2 is basically a bot that uses an OAuth2 flow rather than just the bot token. As with bots, you add these to the Discord server or to user accounts. These credentials offer the same functionalities as bots, but they can simplify the installation of the bot on your server."

If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.\nStuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.\nTo resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.\nDate and time columns are rendering as numbers\nGoogle Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways.\nThe serial number format, popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, .5 represents noon).\nTo use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when Trigger On is set to Row Added:\nOpen the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas.\nSelect Add option.\nSelect DateTime Render.\nChange DateTime Render to Formatted String.\nThe Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format.\nThe number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings. You can change the local by opening the spreadsheet and selecting File > Settings. In the General tab, set Locale to your preferred locale. Select Save settings to adjust the value."

    "content": "Telegram Trigger node common issues\nHere are some common errors and issues with the Telegram Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\nStuck waiting for trigger event\nWhen testing the Telegram Trigger node with the Execute step or Execute workflow buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.\nStuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.\nTo resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.\nBad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook\nThis error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL.\nWhen running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must configure the WEBHOOK_URL environment variable with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS.\nTo fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your WEBHOOK_URL environment variable to use the HTTPS address.\nWorkflow only works in testing or production\nTelegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL.\nYou may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.\nTo work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production.\nTo create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference Telegram's bot documentation and the Telegram bot API reference for more information.\nTo disable your workflow when testing, try the following:\nGo to your workflow page.\nToggle the Active switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.\nTest your workflow using the test webhook URL.\nWhen you finish testing, toggle the Inactive toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working."

Refer to Choose your node building approach for more information.\nPrerequisites\nYou need the following installed on your development machine:\nYou need some understanding of:\nJavaScript/TypeScript\nREST APIs\ngit\nBuild your node\nIn this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the NASA API. You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint.\nStep 1: Set up the project\nn8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.\nClone the repository and navigate into the directory:\nGenerate a new repository from the template repository.\nClone your new repository:\nThe starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:\nnodes/ExampleNode\nnodes/HTTPBin\ncredentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts\ncredentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts\nNow create the following directories and files:\nnodes/NasaPics\nnodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json\nnodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts\ncredentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts\nThese are the key files required for any node. Refer to Node file structure for more information on required files and recommended organization.\nNow install the project dependencies:\nStep 2: Add an icon\nSave the NASA SVG logo from here as nasapics.svg in nodes/NasaPics/.\nStep 3: Create the node\nEvery node must have a base file. Refer to Node base file for detailed information about base file parameters.\nIn this example, the file is NasaPics.node.ts. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to Node file structure for more information.\nStep 3.1: Imports\nStart by adding the import statements:\nStep 3.2: Create the main class\nThe node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a description interface, which in turn contains the properties array.\nStep 3.3: Add node details\nAll nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name, icon, and the basic information for making a request using the node. Add the following to the description:\nn8n uses some of the properties set in description to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are displayName, icon, description, and subtitle.\nStep 3.4: Add resources\nThe resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access two of NASA's API endpoints: planetary/apod and mars-photos. This means you need to define two resource options in NasaPics.node.ts. Update the properties array with the resource object:\ntype controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. options results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to Node UI elements for more information.\nStep 3.5: Add operations\nThe operations object defines the available operations on a resource.\nIn a declarative-style node, the operations object includes routing (within the options array). This sets up the details of the API call.\nAdd the following to the properties array, after the resource object:\nThis code creates two operations: one to get today's APOD image, and another to send a get request for photos from one of the Mars Rovers. The object named roverName requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The routing object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call.\nStep 3.6: Optional fields\nMost APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.\nTo avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under Additional Fields in the UI.\nFor this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array:\nStep 4: Set up authentication\nThe NASA API requires users to authenticate with an API key.\nAdd the following to nasaPicsApi.credentials.ts:\nFor more information about credentials files and options, refer to Credentials file.\nStep 5: Add node metadata\nMetadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is NasaPics.node.json.\nAdd the following code to the JSON file:\nFor more information on these parameters, refer to Node codex files.\nStep 6: Update the npm package details\nYour npm package details are in the package.json at the root of the project. It's essential to include the n8n object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:\nYou need to update the package.json to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm package.json files, refer to npm's package.json documentation.\nTest your node\nNext steps\nDeploy your node.\nView an example of a declarative node: n8n's Brevo node.

These properties are displayName, icon, and description.\nStep 3.4: Add the resource\nThe resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access one of SendGrid's API endpoints: /v3/marketing/contacts. This means you need to define a resource for this endpoint. Update the properties array with the resource object:\ntype controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. options results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to Node UI elements for more information.\nStep 3.5: Add operations\nThe operations object defines what you can do with a resource. It usually relates to REST API verbs (GET, POST, and so on). In this tutorial, there's one operation: create a contact. It has one required field, the email address for the contact the user creates.\nAdd the following to the properties array, after the resource object:\nStep 3.6: Add optional fields\nMost APIs, including the SendGrid API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.\nTo avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under Additional Fields in the UI.\nFor this tutorial, you'll add two additional fields, to allow users to enter the contact's first name and last name. Add the following to the properties array:\nStep 4: Add the execute method\nYou've set up the node UI and basic information. It's time to map the node UI to API requests, and make the node actually do something.\nThe execute method runs every time the node runs. In this method, you have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials.\nAdd the following the execute method in the FriendGrid.node.ts:\nNote the following lines of this code:\nUsers can provide data in two ways:\nEntered directly in the node fields\nBy mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow\ngetInputData(), and the subsequent loop, allows the node to handle situations where data comes from a previous node. This includes supporting multiple inputs. This means that if, for example, the previous node outputs contact information for five people, your FriendGrid node can create five contacts.\nStep 5: Set up authentication\nThe SendGrid API requires users to authenticate with an API key.\nAdd the following to FriendGridApi.credentials.ts\nFor more information about credentials files and options, refer to Credentials file.\nStep 6: Add node metadata\nMetadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file.

This document provides guidance on good code practices for node building. It focuses on code details. For UI standards and UX guidance, refer to Node UI design.\nUse the linter\nThe n8n node linter provides automatic checking for many of the node-building standards. You should ensure your node passes the linter's checks before publishing it. Refer to the n8n node linter documentation for more information.\nUse the starter\nThe n8n node starter project includes a recommended setup, dependencies (including the linter), and examples to help you get started. Begin new projects with the starter.\nWrite in TypeScript\nAll n8n code is TypeScript. Writing your nodes in TypeScript can speed up development and reduce bugs.\nDetailed guidelines for writing a node\nThese guidelines apply to any node you build.\nResources and operations\nIf your node can perform several operations, call the parameter that sets the operation Operation. If your node can do these operations on more than one resource, create a Resource parameter. The following code sample shows a basic resource and operations setup:\nReuse internal parameter names\nAll resource and operation fields in an n8n node have two settings: a display name, set using the name parameter, and an internal name, set using the value parameter. Reusing the internal name for fields allows n8n to preserve user-entered data if a user switches operations.\nFor example: you're building a node with a resource named 'Order'. This resource has several operations, including Get, Edit, and Delete. Each of these operations uses an order ID to perform the operation on the specified order. You need to display an ID field for the user. This field has a display label, and an internal name. By using the same internal name (set in value) for the operation ID field on each resource, a user can enter the ID with the Get operation selected, and not lose it if they switch to Edit.\nWhen reusing the internal name, you must ensure that only one field is visible to the user at a time. You can control this using displayOptions.\nDetailed guidelines for writing a programmatic-style node\nThese guidelines apply when building nodes using the programmatic node-building style. They aren't relevant when using the declarative style. For more information on different node-building styles, refer to Choose your node building approach.\nDon't change incoming data\nNever change the incoming data a node receives (data accessible with this.getInputData()) as all nodes share it. If you need to add, change, or delete data, clone the incoming data and return the new data. If you don't do this, sibling nodes that execute after the current one will operate on the altered data and process incorrect data.\nIt's not necessary to always clone all the data. For example, if a node changes the binary data but not the JSON data, you can create a new item that reuses the reference to the JSON item.\nUse the built in request library\nSome third-party services have their own libraries on npm, which make it easier to create an integration. The problem with these packages is that you add another dependency (plus all the dependencies of the dependencies). This adds more and more code, which has to be loaded, can introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, and so on. Instead, use the built-in module:\nThis uses the npm package Axios.\nRefer to HTTP helpers for more information, and for migration instructions for the removed this.helpers.request."

It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.\nThe file and directory structure of your node depends on:\nYour node's complexity.\nWhether you use node versioning.\nHow many nodes you include in the npm package.\nRequired files and directories\nYour node must include:\nA package.json file at the root of the project. This is required for any npm module.\nA nodes directory, containing the code for your node:\nThis directory must contain the base file, in the format .node.ts. For example, MyNode.node.ts.\nn8n recommends including a codex file, containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named MyNode.node.ts, the codex name is MyNode.node.json.\nThe nodes directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.\nA credentials directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single credentials file. The filename format is .credentials.ts. For example, MyNode.credentials.ts.\nModular structure\nYou can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.\nA basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the HttpBin starter node for an example of this.\nFor more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the Airtable node or Microsoft Outlook node as examples.\nactions: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.\nEach sub-directory should contain two types of files:\nAn index file with resource description (named either .resource.ts or index.ts)\nFiles for operations .operation.ts. These files should have two exports: description of the operation and an execute function.\nmethods: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.\ntransport: a directory containing the communication implementation.\nVersioning\nIf your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to Node versioning for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.\nDecide how many nodes to include in a package\nThere are two possible setups when building a node:\nOne node in one npm package.\nMore than one node in a single npm package.\nn8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the nodes directory.\nA best-practice example for programmatic nodes\nn8n's built-in Airtable node implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns."

    "content": "Node versioning\nn8n supports node versioning. You can make changes to existing nodes without breaking the existing behavior by introducing a new version.\nBe aware of how n8n decides which node version to load:\nIf a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node.\nWhen a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node.\nLight versioning\nThis is available for all node types.\nOne node can contain more than one version, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature:\nChange the main version parameter to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version.\nYou can then access the version parameter with @version in your displayOptions in any object (to control which versions n8n displays the object with). You can also query the version from a function using const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;.\nAs an example, say you want to add versioning to the NasaPics node from the Declarative node tutorial, then configure a resource so that n8n only displays it in version 2 of the node. In your base NasaPics.node.ts file:\nFull versioning\nThis isn't available for declarative-style nodes.\nAs an example, refer to the Mattermost node.\nFull versioning summary:\nThe base node file should extend NodeVersionedType instead of INodeType.\nThe base node file should contain a description including the defaultVersion (usually the latest), other basic node metadata such as name, and a list of versions.

A common pattern is to use a Set node before the node that sends data, to convert the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node, rather than using a Set node. The resource mapper component can also validate input data against the schema provided in the node, and cast input data into the expected type.\nRefer to the Postgres node (version 2) for a live example using a database schema.\nRefer to the Google Sheets node (version 2) for a live example using a schema-less service.\nResource mapper type options interface\nThe typeOptions section must implement the following interface:\nResource mapper method\nThis method contains your node-specific logic for fetching the data schema.

The suggested operations are:\nCreate\nCreate or Update (Upsert)\nDelete\nGet\nGet Many: also used when some filtering or search is available\nUpdate\nNotes:\nThese operations can apply to the resource itself or an entity inside of the resource (for example, a row inside a Google Sheet). When operating on an entity inside of the resource, you must specify the name of the entity in the operations name.\nThe naming could change depending on the node and the resource. Check the following guidelines for details.\nResource Locator\nUse a Resource Locator component whenever possible. This provides a much better UX for users. The Resource Locator Component is most often useful when you have to select a single item.\nThe default option for the Resource Locator Component should be From list (if available).\nConsistency with other nodes\nMaintain UX consistency: n8n tries to keep its UX consistent. This means following existing UX patterns, in particular, those used in the latest new or overhauled nodes.\nCheck similar nodes: For example, if you're working on a database node, it's worth checking the Postgres node.\nSorting options\nYou can enhance certain \"Get Many\" operations by providing users with sorting options.\nAdd sorting in a dedicated collection (below the \"Options\" collection). Follow the example of Airtable Record:Search.\nNode functionality\nDeleting operations output\nWhen deleting an item (like a record or a row), return an array with a single object: {\"deleted\": true}. This is a confirmation for the user that the deletion was successful and the item will trigger the following node.\nSimplifying output fields\nNormal nodes: 'Simplify' parameter\nWhen an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the \"Simplify\" boolean parameter to return a simplified version of the output with max 10 fields.\nOne of the main issues with n8n can be the size of data and the Simplify parameter limits that problem by reducing data size.\nSelect the most useful fields to output in the simplified node and sort them to have the most used ones at the top.\nIn the Simplify mode, it's often best to flatten nested fields\nDisplay Name: Simplify\nDescription: Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data\nAI tool nodes: ‘Output’ parameter\nWhen an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the 'Output' option parameter with 3 modes.\nIn AI tool nodes, allow the user to be more granular and select the fields to output. The rationale is that tools may run out of context window and they can get confused by too many fields, so it's better to pass only the ones they need.\nOptions:\nSimplified: Works the same as the \"Simplify\" parameter described above.\nRaw: Returns all the available fields.\nSelected fields: Shows a multi-option parameter for selecting the fields to add to the output and send to the AI agent. By default, this option always returns the ID of the record/entity.\nCopy\nText Case\nUse Title Case for the node name, parameters display names (labels), dropdown titles. Title Case is when you capitalize the first letter of each word, except for certain small words, such as articles and short prepositions.\nUse Sentence case for node action names, node descriptions, parameters descriptions (tooltips), hints, dropdown descriptions.\nTerminology\nUse the third-party service terminology: Try to use the same terminology as the service you're interfacing with (for example, Notion 'blocks', not Notion 'paragraphs').\nUse the terminology used in the UI: Stick to the terminology used in the user interface of the service, rather than that used in the APIs or technical documentation (for example, in Trello you \"archive\" cards, but in the API they show up as \"closed\". In this case, you might want to use \"archive\").\nNo tech jargon: Don't use technical jargon where simple words will do. For example, use \"field\" instead of \"key\".\nConsistent naming: Choose one term for something and stick to it. For example, don't mix \"directory\" and \"folder\".\nPlaceholders\nIt's often helpful to insert examples of content in parameters placeholders. These should start with \"e.g.\" and use camel case for the demo content in fields.\nPlaceholder examples to copy:\nimage: e.g.\nvideo: e.g.\nsearch term: e.g. automation\nemail: e.g. nathan@example.com\nTwitter user (or similar): e.g. n8n\nName and last name: e.g. Nathan Smith\nFirst name: e.g. Nathan\nLast name: e.g. Smith\nOperations name, action, and description\nName: This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use title case and doesn't have to include the resource (for example, \"Delete\").\nAction: This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. It must be in sentence case and must include the resource (for example, \"Delete record\").\nDescription: This is the sub-text displayed below the name in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use sentence case and must include the resource. It can add a bit of information and use alternative words than the basic resource/operation (for example, \"Retrieve a list of users\").\nIf the operation acts on an entity that's not the Resource (for example, a row in a Google Sheet), specify that in the operation name (for example, \"Delete Row\").\nAs a general rule, is important to understand what the object of an operation is. Sometimes, the object of an Operation is the resource itself (for example, Sheet:Delete to delete a Sheet).\nIn other cases, the object of the operation isn't the resource, but something contained inside the resource (for example, Table:Delete rows, here the resource is the table, but what you are operating on are the rows inside of it).\nNaming name\nThis is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas.\nParameter: name\nCase: Title Case\nNaming guidelines:\nDon't repeat the resource (if the resource selection is above): The resource is often displayed above the operation, so it's not necessary to repeat it in the operation (this is the case if the object of the operation is the resource itself).\nFor example: Sheet:Delete → No need to repeat Sheet in Delete, because n8n displays Sheet in the field above and what you're deleting is the Sheet.\nSpecify the resource if there's no resource selection above: In some nodes, you won't have a resource selection (because there's only one resource). In these cases, specify the resource in the operation.\nFor example: Delete Records → In Airtable, there's no resource selection, so it's better to specify that the Delete operation will delete records.\nSpecify the object of the operation if it's not the resource: Sometimes, the object of the operation isn't the resource. In these cases, specify the object in the operation as well.\nFor example: Table:Get Columns → Specify Columns because the resource is Table, while the object of the operation is Columns.\nNaming action\nThis is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node.\n* Parameter: action\n* Case: Sentence case\nNaming guidelines:\nOmit articles: To keep the text shorter, get rid of articles (a, an, the…).\ncorrect: Update row in sheet\nincorrect: Update a row in a sheet\nRepeat the resource: In this case, it's okay to repeat the resource. Even if the resource is visible in the list, the user might not notice and it's useful to repeat it in the operation label.\nSpecify the object of the operation if it is not the resource: Same as for the operation name. In this case, you don't need to repeat the resource.\nFor example: Append Rows → You have to specify Rows because rows are what you're actually appending to. Don't add the resource (Sheet) since you aren't appending to the resource.\nNaming description\nThis is the subtext displayed below the name in the selection when the node is open on the canvas.\nParameter: description\nCase: Sentence case\nNaming guidelines:\nIf possible, add more information than that specified in the operation name\nUse alternative wording to help users better understand what the operation is doing. Some people might not understand the text used in the operation (maybe English isn't their native language), and using alternative working could help them.\nVocabulary\nn8n uses a general vocabulary and some context-specific vocabulary for groups of similar applications (for example, databases or spreadsheets).\nThe general vocabulary takes inspiration from CRUD operations:\nClear\nDelete all the contents of the resource (empty the resource).\nDescription: Delete all the s inside the\nCreate\nCreate a new instance of the resource.\nDescription: Create a new\nCreate or Update\nCreate or update an existing instance of the resource.\nDescription: Create a new  or update an existing one (upsert)\nDelete\nYou can use \"Delete\" in two different ways:\nDelete a resource:\nDescription: Delete a  permanently (use \"permanently\" only if that's the case)\nDelete something inside of the resource (for example, a row):\nIn this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Delete Rows or Delete Records.\nDescription: Delete a  permanently\nGet\nYou can use \"Get\" in two different ways:\nGet a resource:\nDescription: Retrieve a\nGet an item inside of the resource (for example, records):\nIn this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Get Row or Get Record.\nDescription: Retrieve a  from the/a\nGet Many\nYou can use \"Get Many\" in two different ways:\nGet a list of resources (without filtering):\nDescription: Retrieve a list of s\nGet a list of items inside of the resource (for example, records):\nIn this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Get Many Rows or Get Many Records.\nYou can omit Many: Get Many Rows can be Get Rows.\nDescription: List all s in the/a\nInsert or Append\nAdd something inside of a resource.\nUse insert for database nodes.\nDescription: Insert (s) in a\nInsert or Update or Append or Update\nAdd or update something inside of a resource.\nUse insert for database nodes.\nDescription: Insert (s) or update an existing one(s) (upsert)\nUpdate\nYou can use \"Update\" in two different ways:\nUpdate a resource:\nDescription: Update one or more s\nUpdate something inside of a resource (for example, a row):\nIn this case, always specify the object of the operation: for example, Update Rows or Update Records.\nDescription: Update (s) inside a\nReferring to parameter and field name\nWhen you need to refer to parameter names or field names in copy, wrap them in single quotation marks (for example, \"Please fill the 'name' parameter).\nBoolean description\nStart the description of boolean components with 'Whether...'\nErrors\nGeneral philosophy\nErrors are sources of pain for users. For this reason, n8n always wants to tell the user:\nWhat happened: a description of the error and what went wrong.\nHow to solve the problem: or at least how to get unstuck and continue using n8n without problems. n8n doesn't want users to remain blocked, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to success.\nError structure in the Output panel\nError Message - What happened\nThis message explains to the user what happened, and the current issue that prevents the execution completing.\nIf you have the displayName of the parameter that triggered the error, include it in the error message or description (or both).\nItem index: if you have the ID of the item that triggered the error, append [Item X] to the error message. For example, The ID of the release in the parameter “Release ID” for could not be found [item 2].\nAvoid using words like \"error\", \"problem\", \"failure\", \"mistake\".\nError Description - How to solve or get unstuck\nThe description explains to users how to solve the problem, what to change in the node configuration (if that's the case), or how to get unstuck. Here, you should guide them to the next step and unblock them.\nAvoid using words like \"error\", \"problem\", \"failure\", \"mistake\"."

    "content": "Design your node's user interface\nMost nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.\nThis document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.\nDesign guidance\nAll node's use n8n's node UI elements, so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:\nReview the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:\nWhat can you leave out?\nWhat can you simplify?\nWhich parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?\nUse a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on showing and hiding fields.\nStandards\nUI text style\nTABLE_PLACEHOLDER_0* Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon !\"Screenshot of the tooltip icon. The icon is a ? in a grey circle\". Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.\n* You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information.\n* When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.\n* Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.\nInfo boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.\nErrors\nMake it clear which fields are required.\nAdd validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.\nWhen displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in Details.\nRefer to Node Error Handling for more information.\nToggles\nTooltips for binary states should start with something like Whether to . . . .\nYou may need a list rather than a toggle:\nUse toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, Simplify Output?. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.\nUse a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, Append?. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).\nLists\nSet default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.\nSort list options alphabetically.\nYou can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.\nIf there is an option like All, use the word All, not shorthand like *.\nTrigger node inputs\nWhen a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:\nName the parameter Trigger on.\nDon't include a tooltip.\nSubtitles\nSet subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:\nIDs\nWhen performing an operation on a specific record, such as \"update a task comment\" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.\nWherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:\nBy choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the loadOptions parameter. Refer to Base files for more information.\nBy entering an ID.\nName the field  name or ID. For example, Workspace Name or ID. Add a tooltip saying \"Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression.\" Link to n8n's Expressions documentation.\nBuild your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:\nIf you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.\nIf the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.\nDates and timestamps\nn8n uses ISO timestamp strings for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.\nJSON\nYou should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:\nTyping JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.\nUsing an expression that returns JSON.\nNode icons\nCommon patterns and exceptions\nThis section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards.\nSimplify responses\nAPIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data:\nName: Simplify Response\nDescription: Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data\nUpsert operations\nThis should always be a separate operation with:\nName: Create or Update\nDescription: Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert)\nBoolean operators\nn8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs.\nFor example, you have a field called Must match to test if values match. Include options to test for Any and All, as separate options.\nSource keys or binary properties\nBinary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms \"binary data\" or \"binary property\" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: Input data field name / Output data field name."

The linter fixes violations of rules marked as automatically fixable.\nBoth commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in /packages/nodes-base/ in the main repository.\nExceptions\nInstead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.\nTo make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on Quick fix (or cmd+. in macOS) and select Disable {rule} for this line. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please report it in the linter repository.\nTo add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the TSLint documentation for more guidance."

If this happens, the instance can crash and become inaccessible.\nData storage: depending on your execution settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage.\nTo avoid these issues, n8n recommends that you build your workflows with memory efficiency in mind, and don't save unnecessary data\nMemory limits on each Cloud plan\nCurrent plans:\nTrial: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\nStarter: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\nPro-1 (10k executions): 640MiB RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable\nPro-2 (50k executions): 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\nEnterprise: 4096MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\nLegacy plans:\nStart: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\nPower: 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\nn8n gives each instance up to 100GB of data storage.\nHow to reduce memory consumption in your workflow\nThe way you build workflows affects how much data they consume when executed. Although these guidelines aren't applicable to all cases, they provide a baseline of best practices to avoid exceeding instance memory.\nNote that n8n itself consumes memory to run. On average, the software alone uses around 180MiB RAM.\nInteractions with the UI also consume memory. Playing around with the workflow UI while it performs heavy executions could also push the memory capacity over the limit.\nHow to manage execution data on Cloud\nExecution data includes node data, parameters, variables, execution context, and binary data references. It's text-based.\nBinary data is non-textual data that n8n can't represent as plain text. This is files and media such as images, documents, audio files, and videos. It's much larger than textual data.\nIf a workflow consumes a large amounts of data and is past testing stage, it's a good option to stop saving the successful executions.\nThere are two ways you can control how much execution data n8n stores in the database:\nIn the admin dashboard:\nFrom your workspace or editor, navigate to Admin Panel.\nSelect Manage.\nIn Executions to Save deselect the executions you don't want to log.\nIn your workflow settings:\nSelect the Options !Options menu{.off-glb} menu.\nSelect Settings. n8n opens the Workflow settings modal.\nChange Save successful production executions to Do not save.\nCloud data pruning and out of memory incident prevention\nAutomatic data pruning\nn8n automatically prunes execution logs after a certain time or once you reach the max storage limit, whichever comes first. The pruning always happens from oldest to newest and the limits depend on your Could plan:\nStart and Starter plans: max 2500 executions saved and 7 days execution log retention;\nPro and Power plans: max 25000 executions saved and 30 days execution log retention;\nEnterprise plan: max 50000 executions saved and unlimited execution log retention time.\nManual data pruning\nHeavier executions and use cases can exceed database capacity despite the automatic pruning practices. In cases like this, n8n will manually prune data to protect instance stability.\nAn alert system warns n8n if an instance is at 85% disk capacity.\nn8n prunes execution data. n8n does this by running a backup of the instance (workflows, users, credentials and execution data) and restoring it without execution data.\nDue to the human steps in this process, the alert system isn't perfect. If warnings are triggered after hours or if data consumption rates are high, there might not be time to prune the data before the remaining disk space fills up."

As a Processor, n8n implements policies and practices that secure the personal data you send to the platform, and includes a Data Processing Agreement as part of the company's standard Terms of Service.\nThe n8n Data Processing Agreement includes the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). These clarify how n8n handles your data, and they update n8n's GDPR policies to cover the latest standards set by the European Commission.\nYou can find a list of n8n sub-processors here.\nSubmitting a GDPR deletion request\nEmail privacy@n8n.io to request data deletion.\nSub-processors\nThis is a list of sub-processors authorized to process customer data for n8n's service. n8n audits each sub-processor's security controls and applicable regulations for the protection of personal data.\nTABLE_PLACEHOLDER_0\nSubscribe here to receive updates when n8n adds or changes a sub-processor.\nGDPR for self-hosted users\nData collection\nn8n collects selected usage and performance data to help diagnose problems and improve the platform. Read about how n8n stores and processes this information in the privacy policy.\nThe data gathered is different in self-hosted n8n and n8n Cloud.\nData collection in self-hosted n8n\nn8n takes care to keep self-hosted data anonymous and avoids collecting sensitive data.\nWhat n8n collects\nError codes and messages of failed executions (excluding any payload data, and not for custom nodes)\nError reports for app crashes and API issues\nThe graph of a workflow (types of nodes used and how they're connected)\nFrom node parameters:\nThe 'resource' and 'operation' that a node is set to (if applicable)\nFor HTTP request nodes, the domain, path, and method (with personal data anonymized)\nData around workflow executions:\nStatus\nThe user ID of the user who ran the execution\nThe first time a workflow loads data from an external source\nThe first successful production (non-manual) workflow execution\nThe domain of webhook calls, if specified (excluding subdomain).\nDetails on how the UI is used (for example, navigation, nodes panel searches)\nDiagnostic information:\nn8n version\nSelected settings:\nDB_TYPE\nN8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED\nN8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS\nExecution variables\nOS, RAM, and CPUs\nAnonymous instance ID\nIP address\nWhat n8n doesn't collect\nn8n doesn't collect private or sensitive information, such as:\nPersonally identifiable information (except IP address)\nCredential information\nNode parameters (except 'resource' and 'operation')\nExecution data\nSensitive settings (for example, endpoints, ports, DB connections, username/password)\nError payloads\nHow collection works\nMost data is sent to n8n as events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours).\nOpting out of telemetry\nTelemetry collection is enabled by default. To disable it you can configure the following environment variables.\nTo opt out of telemetry events:\nTo opt out of checking for new versions of n8n:\nTo disable the templates feature (prevents background health check calls):\nSee configuration for more info on how to set environment variables.\nData collection in n8n Cloud\nn8n Cloud collects everything listed in Data collection in self-hosted n8n.\nAdditionally, in n8n Cloud, n8n uses PostHog to track events and visualise usage, including using session recordings. Session recordings comprise the data seen by a user on screen, with the exception of credential values. n8n's product team uses this data to improve the product. All recordings are deleted after 21 days.\nAI in n8n\nTo provide enhanced assistance, n8n integrates AI-powered features that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs).\nHow n8n uses AI\nTo assist and improve user experience, n8n may send specific context data to LLMs. This context data is strictly limited to information about the current workflow. n8n does not send any values from credential fields or actual output data to AI services. The data will not be incorporated, used, or retained to train the models of the AI services. Any data will be deleted after 30 days.\nWhen n8n shares data\nData is only sent to AI services if workspaces have opted in to use the assistant. The Assistant is enabled by default for n8n Cloud users. When a workspace opts in to use the assistant, node-specific data is transmitted only during direct interactions and active sessions with the AI assistant, ensuring no unnecessary data sharing occurs.\nWhat n8n shares\nGeneral Workflow Information: This includes details about which nodes are present in your workflow, the number of items currently in the workflow, and whether the workflow is active.\nInput & Output Schemas of Nodes: This includes the schema of all nodes with incoming data and the output schema of a node in question. We do not send the actual data value of the schema.\nNode Configuration: This includes the operations, options, and settings chosen in the referenced node.\nCode and Expressions: This includes any code or expressions in the node in question to help with debugging potential issues and optimizations.\nWhat n8n doesn't share\nCredentials: Any values of the credential fields of your nodes.\nOutput Data: The actual data processed by your workflows.\nSensitive Information: Any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that could compromise your privacy or security that you have not explicitly mentioned in node parameters or your code of a Code Node.\nDocumentation telemetry\nn8n's documentation (this website) uses cookies to recognize your repeated visits and preferences, as well as to measure the effectiveness of n8n's documentation and whether users find what they're searching for. With your consent, you're helping n8n to make our documentation better. You can control cookie consent using the cookie widget.\nRetention and deletion of personal identifiable data\nPID (personal identifiable data) is data that's personal to you and would identify you as an individual.\nn8n Cloud\nPID retention\nn8n only retains data for as long as necessary to provide the core service.\nFor n8n Cloud, n8n stores your workflow code, credentials, and other data indefinitely, until you choose to delete it or close your account. The platform stores execution data according to the retention rules on your account.\nn8n deletes most internal application logs and logs tied to subprocessors within 90 days. The company retains a subset of logs for longer periods where required for security investigations.\nPID deletion\nIf you choose to delete your n8n account, n8n deletes all customer data and event data associated with your account. n8n deletes customer data in backups within 90 days.\nSelf-hosted\nSelf-hosted users should have their own PID policy and data deletion processes. Refer to What you can do for more information.\nPayment processor\nn8n uses Paddle.com to process payments. When you sign up for a paid plan, Paddle transmits and stores the details of your payment method according to their security policy. n8n stores no information about your payment method."

This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.\nRefer to Node user interface elements TABLE_PLACEHOLDER_0* Editor: add the HTML editor component for use in parameters.

This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n.\n#### Data pinning\nData pinning allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development.\n#### Data mapping\nThis release introduces a drag and drop interface for data mapping, as a quick way to map data without using expressions.\n#### Simplify authentication setup for node creators\nThis release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an authenticate property that dictates how the credential is used in a request.\nn8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as \"generic\", and use the IAuthenticateGeneric interface.\nYou can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth.\nFor an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's Asana node.\nOther new features\nAdded a preAuthentication method to credentials.\nAdded more credentials tests.\nIntroduce automatic fixing for paired item information in some scenarios.\nNode enhancements\nERPNext node: add credential tests, and add support for unauthorized certs.\nGoogle Drive node: add support for move to trash.\nMindee node: support new version.\nNotion node: support ignoring the Notion URL property if empty.\nShopify node: add OAuth support.\nBug fixes\nAPI: add missing node settings parameters.\nAPI: validate static data value for resource workflow.\nBaserow Node: fix an issue preventing table names from loading.\nEditor: hide the Execute previous node button when in read-only mode.\nEditor: hide tabs if there's only one branch.\nRoundup of link fixes in nodes.\nContributors\nFlorian Bachmann\nOlivier Aygalenq\nn8n@0.186.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2022-07-14\nThis is a bug fix release.

It solves an issue with setting credentials in the HTTP Request node.\nn8n@0.178.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2022-05-24\nThis release adds support for reusing existing credentials in the HTTP Request node, making it easier to do custom operation with APIs where n8n already has an integration.\nThe release also includes improvements to the nodes view, giving better detail about incoming data, as well as some bug fixes.\nNew features\n#### Credential reuse for custom API operations\nn8n supplies hundreds of nodes, allowing you to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.\nOne of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. To simplify this, n8n now provides a way to use existential credential types (credentials associated with n8n nodes) in the HTTP Request node.\nFor more information, refer to Custom API operations.\n#### Node details view\nAn improved node view, showing more detail about node inputs.\nNode enhancements\nSalesforce Node: Add the Country field.\nBug fixes\nEditor UI: don't display the dividing line unless necessary.\nEditor UI: don't display the 'Welcome' sticky in template workflows.\nSlack Node: Fix the kick operation for the channel resource.\nn8n@0.177.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2022-05-17\nThis release contains node enhancements, an improved welcome experience, and bug fixes.\nNew features\n#### Improved welcome experience\nA new introductory video, automatically displayed for new users.\n#### Automatically convert Luxon dates to strings\nn8n now automatically converts Luxon DateTime objects to strings.\nNode enhancements\nGoogle Drive Node: Drive upload, delete, and share operations now support shared Drives.\nMicrosoft OneDrive: Add the rename operation for files and folders.\nTrello: Add support for operations relating to board members.\nBug fixes\ncore: Fix call to /executions-current with unsaved workflow.\ncore: Fix issue with fixedCollection having all default values.\nEdit Image Node: Fix font selection.\nGhost Node: Fix post tags and add credential tests.\nGoogle Calendar Node: Make it work with public calendars and clean up.\nKoBoToolbox Node: Fix query and sort + use question name in attachments.\nMailjet Trigger Node: Fix issue that node couldn't get activated.\nPipedrive Node: Fix resolve properties when using multi option field.\nContributors\nCristobal Schlaubitz Garcia\nYann Jouanique\nn8n@0.176.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2022-05-10\nThis release contains bug fixes and node enhancements.\nNode enhancements\nPipedrive node: adds support for filters to the Organization: Get All operation.\nPushover node: adds an HTML formatting option, and a credential test.\nUProc node: adds new tools.\nBug fixes\ncore: a fix for filtering the executions list by waiting status.\ncore: improved webhook error messages.\nEdit Image node: node now works correctly with the binary-data-mode 'filesystem'.\nContributors\nAlbert Kiskorov\nMiquel Colomer\nn8n@0.175.1\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2022-05-03\nThis is a bug fix release.\nBug fixes\nFixes a bug in the editor UI related to node versioning.\nn8n@0.175.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2022-05-02\nThis release adds support for node versioning, along with node enhancements and bug fixes.\nNew features\n#### Node versioning\n0.175.0 adds support for a lightweight method of node versioning. One node can contain multiple versions, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature, change the version parameter in your node to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with @version in your displayOptions (to control which version n8n displays). You can also query the version in your execute function using const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;.\nNode enhancements\nGoogle Sheets node: n8n now handles header names formatted as JSON paths.\nMicrosoft Dynamics CRM node: add support for regions other than North America.\nTelegram node: add support for querying chat administrators.\nBug fixes\ncore: fixed an issue that was causing n8n to apply authentication checks, even when user management was disabled.\ncore: n8n now skips credentials checks for disabled nodes.\neditor: fix a bug affecting touchscreen monitors.\nHubSpot node: fix for search operators.\nSendGrid node: fixed an issue with sending attachments.\nWise node: respect the time parameter on get: exchangeRate.\nContributors\nJack Rudenko\nMC Naveen\nvcrwr\nn8n@0.174.0\nView the commits for this version.\nRelease date: 2022-04-25\nNew features\n#### Sticky Notes\nThis release adds Sticky Notes, a new feature that allows you to annotate and comment on your workflows.

    "content": "Tutorial: Create environments with source control\nThis tutorial walks through the process of setting up environments end-to-end. You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers.\nn8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to:\nEnvironments in n8n: the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n.\nGit and n8n: Git concepts and source control in n8n.\nChoose your source control pattern\nBefore setting up source control and environments, you need to plan your environments, and how they relate to Git branches. n8n supports different Branch patterns. For environments, you need to choose between two patterns: multi-instance, multi-branch, or multi-instance, single-branch. This tutorial covers both patterns.\nMultiple instances, multiple branches\n!Diagram\nMultiple instances, one branch\n!Diagram\nSet up your repository\nOnce you've chosen your pattern, you need to set up your GitHub repository.\n=== \"Multi-branch\"\n1. Create a new repository.\n* Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.\n* Create the new repository with a README so you can immediately create branches.\n1. Create one branch named production and another named development. Refer to Creating and deleting branches within your repository for guidance.\n=== \"Single-branch\"\nCreate a new repository.\n* Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.\n* Create the new repository with a README. This creates the main branch, which you'll connect to.\nConnect your n8n instances to your repository\nCreate two n8n instances, one for development, one for production.\nConfigure Git in n8n\nSet up a deploy key\nSet up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. Refer to GitHub | Managing deploy keys for guidance.\nConnect n8n and configure your instance\n=== \"Multi-branch\"\n1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.\n1. Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance. Connect the production branch to the production instance, and the development branch to the development instance.\n1. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.\n1. Select **Save settings**.\n=== \"Single-branch\"\n1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**.\n1. Under **Instance settings**, select the main branch.\n1. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.\n1. Select **Save settings**.\nPush work from development\nIn your development instance, create a few workflows, tags, variables, and credentials.\nPull work to production\nYour work is now in GitHub. If you're using a multi-branch setup, it's on the development branch. If you chose the single-branch setup, it's on main.\n=== \"Multi-branch\"\n1. In GitHub, create a pull request to merge development into production.\n1. Merge the pull request.\n1. In your production instance, select **Pull** <span class=\"inline-image\">!Pull icon{.off-glb}</span> in the main menu.\n=== \"Single-branch\"\nIn your production instance, select **Pull** <span class=\"inline-image\">!Pull icon{.off-glb}</span> in the main menu.\nOptional: Use a GitHub Action to automate pulls\nIf you want to avoid logging in to your production instance to pull, you can use a GitHub Action and the n8n API to automatically pull every time you push new work to your production or main branch.\nNext steps\nLearn more about:\nEnvironments in n8n and Git and n8n\nSource control patterns"

To use this feature, it helps to have some knowledge of basic Git concepts. n8n doesn't implement all Git functionality: you shouldn't view n8n's source control as full version control.\nThis page introduces the Git concepts and terminology used in n8n. It doesn't cover everything you need to set up and manage a repository. The person doing the Setup should have some familiarity with Git and with their Git hosting provider.\nGit overview\nGit is a tool for managing, tracking, and collaborating on multiple versions of documents. It's the basis for widely used platforms such as GitHub and GitLab.\nBranches: Multiple copies of a project\nGit uses branches to maintain multiple copies of a document alongside each other. Every branch has its own version. A common pattern is to have a main branch, and then everyone who wants to contribute to the project works on their own branch (copy). When they finish their work, their branch is merged back into the main branch.\n!Diagram\nLocal and remote: Moving work between your machine and a Git provider\nA common pattern when using Git is to install Git on your own computer, and use a Git provider such as GitHub to work with Git in the cloud. In effect, you have a Git repository (project) on GitHub, and work with copies of it on your local machine.\nn8n uses this pattern for source control: you'll work with your workflows on your n8n instance, but send them to your Git provider to store them.\nPush, pull, and commit\nn8n uses three key Git processes:\nPush: send work from your instance to Git. This saves a copy of your workflows and tags, as well as credential and variable stubs, to Git. You can choose which workflows you want to save.\nPull: get the workflows, tags, and variables from Git and load it into n8n. You will need to populate any credentials or variable stubs included in the refreshed items.\nCommit: a commit in n8n is a single occurrence of pushing work to Git. In n8n, commit and push happen at the same time.\nRefer to Push and pull for detailed information about how n8n interacts with Git."

You can create different setups depending on your needs.\nMultiple instances, multiple branches\nThis pattern involves having multiple n8n instances, each one linked to its own branch.\nYou can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them to their own branches. Push work from your development instance to its branch, do a pull request to move work to the production branch, then pull to the production instance.\n!Diagram\nMultiple instances, one branch\nUse this pattern if you want the same workflows, tags, and variables everywhere, but want to use them in different n8n instances.\nYou can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them both to the same branch. Push work from development, and pull it into production.\nThis pattern is also useful when testing a new version of n8n: you can create a new n8n instance with the new version, connect it to the Git branch and test it, while your production instance remains on the older version until you're confident it's safe to upgrade.\n!Diagram\nOne instance, multiple branches\nThe instance owner can change which Git branch connects to the instance. The full setup in this case is likely to be a Multiple instances, multiple branches pattern, but with one instance switching between branches.\nThis is useful to review work. For example, different users could work on their own instance and push to their own branch. The reviewer could work in a review instance, and switch between branches to load work from different users.\n!Diagram\nOne instance, one branch\nThis is the simplest pattern.\n!Diagram"

Select Pull and override to override your local work with the content in Git.\nWhen the changes include new variable or credential stubs, n8n notifies you that you need to populate the values for the items before using them.\nWorkflow and credential owner may change on pull\nWhen you pull from Git to an n8n instance, n8n tries to assign workflows and credentials to a matching user or project.\nIf the original owner is a user:\nIf the same owner is available on both instances (matching email), the owner remains the same. If the original owner isn't on the new instance, n8n sets the user performing the pull as the workflow owner.\nIf the original owner is a project:\nn8n tries to match the original project name to a project name on the new instance.

This may result in a few seconds of downtime for the workflow.\nSend your work to Git\nWhat gets committed\nn8n commits the following to Git:\nWorkflows, including their tags and the email address of the workflow owner. You can choose which workflows to push.\nCredential stubs (ID, name, type)\nVariable stubs (ID and name)\nProjects\nFolders\nMerge behaviors and conflicts\nn8n's implementation of source control is opinionated. It resolves merge conflicts for credentials and variables automatically. n8n can't detect conflicts on workflows.\nWorkflows\nYou have to explicitly tell n8n what to do about workflows when pushing or pulling. The Git repository acts as the source of truth.\nWhen pulling, you might get warned that your local copy of a workflow differs from Git, and if you accept, your local copy would be overridden. Be careful not to lose relevant changes when pulling.\nWhen you push, your local workflow will override what's in Git, so make sure that you have the most up to date version or you risk overriding recent changes.\nTo prevent the issue described above, you should immediately push your changes to a workflow once you finish working on it. Then it's safe to pull.\nTo avoid losing data:\nDesign your source control setup so that workflows flow in one direction. For example, make edits on a development instance, push to Git, then pull to production. Don't make edits on the production instance and push them.\nDon't push all workflows. Select the ones you need.\nBe cautious about manually editing files in the Git repository.\nCredentials, variables and workflow tags\nCredentials and variables can't have merge issues, as n8n chooses the version to keep.\nOn pull:\nIf the tag, variable or credential doesn't exist, n8n creates it.\nIf the tag, variable or credential already exists, n8n doesn't update it, unless:\nYou set the value of a variable using the API or externally. The new value overwrites any existing value.\nThe credential name has changed. n8n uses the version in Git.\nThe name of a tag has changed. n8n updates the tag name. Be careful when renaming tags as tag names are unique and this could cause database issues when it comes to uniqueness during the pull process.\nOn push:\nn8n overwrites the entire variables and tags files.\nIf a credential already exists, n8n overwrites it with the changes, but doesn't apply these changes to existing credentials on pull."

Select the Create Workflow to create a new workflow.\nStep two: Add a trigger node\nn8n provides two ways to start a workflow:\nManually, by selecting Execute Workflow.\nAutomatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.\nFor this tutorial, we'll use the Schedule trigger. This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule:\nSelect Add first step.\nSearch for Schedule. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\nSelect Schedule Trigger to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.\nFor Trigger Interval, select Weeks.\nFor Weeks Between Triggers, enter 1.\nEnter a time and day. For this example, select Monday in Trigger on Weekdays, select 9am in Trigger at Hour, and enter 0 in Trigger at Minute.\nClose the node details view to return to the canvas.\nStep three: Add the NASA node and set up credentials\nThe NASA node interacts with NASA's public APIs to fetch useful data. We will use the real-time data from the API to find solar events.\n??? explanation \"Credentials\"\nCredentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.\nSelect the Add node !Add node icon{.off-glb} connector on the Schedule Trigger node.\nSearch for NASA. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\nSelect NASA to view a list of operations.\nSearch for and select Get a DONKI solar flare. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\nTo access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:\nSelect the  Credential for NASA API dropdown.\nSelect Create new credential. n8n opens the credentials view.\nGo to NASA APIs and fill out the form from the Generate API Key link. The NASA site generates the key and emails it to the address you entered.\nCheck your email account for the API key. Copy the key, and paste it into API Key in n8n.\nSelect Save.\nClose the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in Credential for NASA API.\nBy default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use Additional Fields:\nSelect Add field.\nSelect Start date.\nTo get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to Start date, select the Expression tab, then select the expand button !Add node icon{.off-glb} to open the full expressions editor.\nIn the Expression field, enter the following expression:\nThis generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date.\n!image showing the expression above generating a date\n??? explanation \"Date and time formats in n8n...\"\nn8n uses Luxon to work with date and time, and also provides two variables for convenience: $now and $today. For more information, refer to Expressions > Luxon.\nClose the Edit Expression modal to return to the NASA node.\nYou can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select Execute step to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the OUTPUT section.\nClose the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas.\nStep four: Add logic with the If node\nn8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial we will use the If node to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications; we will add logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another.\nAdd the If node:\nSelect the Add node !Add node icon{.off-glb} connector on the NASA node.\nSearch for If. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\nSelect If to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.\nYou need to check the value of the classType property in the NASA data. To do this:\nDrag classType into Value 1.\nChange the comparison operation to String > Contains.\nIn Value 2, enter X. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.\nYou can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select Execute step to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the OUTPUT panel.\nOnce you are happy the node will return some events, you can close the node to return to the canvas.\nStep five: Output data from your workflow\nThe last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to Postbin. Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page.\nOn the If node, select the Add node !Add node icon{.off-glb} connector labeled true.\nSearch for PostBin. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\nSelect PostBin.\nSelect Send a request. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\nGo to Postbin and select Create Bin. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.\nCopy the bin ID. It looks similar to 1651063625300-2016451240051.\nIn n8n, paste your Postbin ID into Bin ID.\nNow, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to Bin Content, select the Expression tab (you will need to mouse-over the Bin Content for the tab to appear), then select the expand button !Add node icon{.off-glb} to open the full expressions editor.\nYou can now click and drag the correct field from the If Node output into the expressions editor to automatically create a reference for this label. In this case the input we want is 'classType'.\nOnce dropped into the expressions editor it will transform into this reference: {{$json[\"classType\"]}}. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:\n!image showing the expression above generating output\nClose the expressions editor to return to the node.\nClose the Postbin node to return to the canvas.\nAdd another Postbin node, to handle the false output path from the If node:\nHover over the Postbin node, then select Node context menu !Node context menu icon{.off-glb} > Duplicate node to duplicate the first Postbin node.\nDrag the false connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node.\nStep six: Test the workflow\nYou can now test the entire workflow. Select Execute Workflow. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.\nGo back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.\nIf you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the Active toggle.\nCongratulations\nYou now have a fully functioning workflow that does something useful! It should look something like this:\nAlong the way you have discovered:\nHow to find the nodes you want and join them together\nHow to use expressions to manipulate data\nHow to create credentials and attach them to nodes\nHow to use logic in your workflows\nThere are plenty of things you could add to this (perhaps add some more credentials and a node to send you an email of the results), or maybe you have a specific project in mind.

They're labeled like this to indicate that if the node executes again, the output may be different. It may also be the point where a partial execution starts from.\nHow to recognize dirty node data\nIn the canvas of the workflow editor, you can identify dirty notes by their different-colored border and a yellow triangle in place of the previous green tick symbol. For example:\n!\"Image of node displayed with yellow border\"\nIn the node editor view, the output panel also displays a yellow triangle on the output panel. If you hover over the triangle, a tooltip appears with more information about why n8n considers the data stale:\n!\"Image of node displayed with yellow border\"\nWhy n8n marks nodes dirty\nThere are several reasons why n8n might flag execution data as stale. For example:\nInserting or deleting a node: labels the first node that follows the inserted node dirty.\nModifying node parameters: labels the modified node dirty.\nAdding a connector: labels the destination node of the new connector dirty.\nDeactivating a node: labels the first node that follows the deactivated node dirty.\n??? explanation \"Other reasons n8n marks nodes dirty\"\n- Unpinning a node: labels the unpinned node dirty.\n- Modifying pinned data: labels the node that comes after the pinned data dirty.\n- If any of the above actions occur inside a loop, also labels the first node of the loop dirty.\nFor sub-nodes, also labels any executed parent nodes (up to and including the root) when:\n- Editing an executed sub-node\n- Adding a new sub-node\n- Disconnecting or deleting a sub-node\n- Deactivating a sub-node\n- Activating a sub-node\n-   When deleting a connected node in a workflow:\n!\"Image of node displayed with yellow border\"\n-   The next node in the sequence becomes dirty:\n!\"Image of node displayed with yellow border\"\nWhen using loops (with the Loop over Items node), when any node within the loop is dirty, the initial node of the loop is also considered dirty:\n!\"Image of node displayed with yellow border\"\nResolving dirty nodes\nExecuting a node again clears its dirty status.

    "content": "Manual, partial, and production executions\nThere are some important differences in how n8n executes workflows manually (by clicking the Execute Workflow button) and automatically (when the workflow is Active and triggered by an event or schedule).\nManual executions\nManual executions allow you to run workflows directly from the canvas to test your workflow logic. These executions are \"ad-hoc\": they run only when you manually select the Execute workflow button.\nManual executions make building workflows easier by allowing you to iteratively test as you go, following the flow logic and seeing data transformations. You can test conditional branching, data formatting changes, and loop behavior by providing different input items and modifying node options.\nPartial executions\nClicking the Execute workflow button at the bottom of the workflow in the Editor tab manually runs the entire workflow. You can also perform partial executions to run specific steps in your workflow. Partial executions are manual executions that only run a subset of your workflow nodes.\nTo perform a partial execution, select a node, open its detail view, and select Execute step. This executes the specific node and any preceding nodes required to fill in its input data. You can also temporarily disable specific nodes in the workflow chain to avoid interacting with those services while building.\nIn particular, partial executions are useful when updating the logic of a specific node since they allow you to re-execute the node with the same input data.\nTroubleshooting partial executions\nSome common issues you might come across when running partial executions include the following:\nThe destination node is not connected to any trigger. Partial executions need a trigger.\nThis error message appears when you try to perform a partial execution without connecting the workflow to a trigger. Manual executions, including partial executions, attempt to mimic production executions when possible. Part of this includes requiring a trigger node to describe when the workflow logic should execute.\nTo work around this, connect a trigger node to the workflow with the node you're trying to execute. Most often, a manual trigger is the simplest option.\nPlease execute the whole workflow, rather than just the node. (Existing execution data is too large.)\nThis error can appear when performing partial executions on workflows with large numbers of branches. Partial executions involve sending data and workflow logic to the n8n backend in a way that isn't required for full executions. This error occurs when your workflow exceeds the maximum size allowed for these messages.\nTo work around this, consider using the limit node to limit node output while running partial executions. Once the workflow is running as intended, you can disable or delete the limit node before enabling production execution.\nProduction executions\nProduction executions occur when a triggering event or schedule automatically runs a workflow.\nTo configure production executions, you must attach a trigger node (any trigger other than the manual trigger works) and switch workflow's toggle to Active. Once activated, the workflow automatically executes whenever the trigger condition occurs.\nThe execution flow for production executions doesn't display in the Editor tab of the workflow as with manual executions. Instead, you can see executions in the workflow's Executions tab according to your workflow settings. From there, you can explore and troubleshoot problems using the debug in editor feature."
